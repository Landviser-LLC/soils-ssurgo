# soils-ssurgo

Planning this SSURGO repo. This is a learning repo on basics of Git, Python, Virtual Environments, Spatial Data, ArcGIS, QGIS, webmaps, 

Need to setup venv (Python 3.8). Only basic modules to requirments.txt .gitignore.

1. download and extract SSURGO files per county. - how to put those to GDrive?
2. script to extract and summarize soil properties to mukey - multilevel weighted everages
3. combine several counties spatial/tabular
4. merge spatial/tabular
5. push layer to AGOL (how to use ArcGIS Pro env?) / create REST API at our hosting?

MLRA 131A - Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium

Geographic Extent: These mapping units are level to gently sloping natural levees and low terraces along former channels of the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium Major Land Resource Area; MLRA 131


Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 894 to 1545 mm (35 to 61 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 8.8 to 21.6 degrees C (48 to 71 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 195 to 269 days
Soil Moisture Class: aquic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: level to gently sloping soils on natural levees and low terraces along former channels of the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium Major Land Resource Area


Minor Components: 
Aquents: small narrow drainageways on terrace treads
Amagon: low concave depressions on terrace treads 


Parent Material: loamy alluvium


Typical Vegetation or Crops: row crops - Corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, and wheat. Pasture/hayland crops - tall fescue, improved bermudagrass
 

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Dundee   89%
Amagon    6%
Aquents   5%
 

Classification: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Endoaqualfs 


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations: Typically the surface is Dark grayish brown, friable silt loam; the subsurface is grayish brown friable silt loam; the upper part of the subsoil is grayish brown friable silt loam, the lower subsoil is firm, grayish brown silty clay loam; the lower solum and parent material is friable light grayish brown silt loam. 


Reaction: Surface layer - Extremely acid to moderately except where limed; Subsurface and subsoil layers - very strongly acid to moderately acid; parent material (below solum) very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR: Aquents component does not occur in all mapunit represented in this project. However, most of these mapunits are on very large terrace treads that do have small narrow drainageways that have narrow flood plains, and Amagon would be similar to most aqualf components, thus aquents was chosen to be an RV component.


Spatial Data Quality: Numerous county line joins need to be investigated. Many misjoins are simply slope related.

Mapunit Name - Jackport silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 131A - Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent: MLRA 131A -  level to nearly level soils on Pleistocene terraces in the lower Mississippi Valley.


Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 894 mm to 1456 mm (35 to 57 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 10 to 21 degrees C (50 to 70 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 190 to 260 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting: Jackport soils occur on broad low terraces of the Mississippi delta.  Typically, the surface layer is dark grayish brown, mottled silty clay loam about 5 inches thick.  The subsurface layer is gray, mottled silty clay loam about seven inches thick.  The subsoil is dark grayish brown, silty clay to a depth of about 17 inches, mottled clay to a depth of about 48 inches and olive gray to a depth of about 58 inches. The underlying material is olive gray, mottled silty clay loam that extends to a depth of 72 inches or more.

Major Component: Jackport silty clay


Minor Components:  

Aqualfs - is slightly higher positions


Parent Material: Clayey alluvium (sometimes overlying loamy alluvium)


Typical Vegetation or Crops: Most of the acreage of this soil is used for cropland, mainly soybeans. Other common crops include rice, grain sorghum, and cotton. Fescue is the principal pasture crops. 
 

Mapunit Composition and Reliability: 

Major: Jackport 90%
Minor: aqualfs   10%
	  
	   
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from seven to one.
This mapunit is supported by seven pedon descriptions. These seven pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the seven counties where this mapunit is correlated. 

Classification: FINE, SMECTITIC, THERMIC CHROMIC EPIAQUERTS 


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Jackport series was established in Jackson County, Arkansas in 1941.

Reaction: Very strongly acid to Slightly acid


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The Jackport series is mapped in two different surface phases in Arkansas and misjoins are likely.  The heavier silty clay phase is limited to the northern extent of the range of the series, but flanks the lighter silty clay loam phase in two northern Arkansas counties.


Spatial Data Quality:
Potential mis-joins (surface texture phases) occur at county lines and should be studied as a future project.

The Leadvale series consists of deep to very deep, moderately well drained soils with a fragipan. Taxonomic class is: Fine-silty, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Typic Fragiudults

This map unit has a loosely defined mapping concept where it is recognized.  Manuscripts define the proper landform for the map unit as old stream terraces, however, delineations encompass toe slopes as well as stream terraces and some flood plains. Silty pedisediment and silty alluvium are the parent materials for this map unit, depending on the location of the delineation.

Most acreage of this map unit has been cleared and is used as pasture or hay land. 

The Leadvale component often has a perched water table at around 51-cm during the winter and spring months.

Flooding frequency: None

Associated soils: Delineations of this map unit are known to include the Taft soil. Taft is poorly drained, has a glossic horizon, and has gray mottles in the upper 10 inches of the B horizons. Some delineations are known to contain inclusions of hydric soils, such as the Guthrie series. Guthrie soils are poorly drained and have dominant chroma of 2 or less between the base of the Ap horizons and the fragipans. It is recognized that there are inclusions that resemble the Leadvale series, with a paralithic contact at a depth of less than 130-cm.

The  map unit composition was estimated from manuscripts, using modern soil series concepts. There is no map unit composition data on file for this map unit, which will need to be investigated in the future. 

The map unit is delineated on several geological formations; these formations are mostly consistent in age and morphology. The series is found on different Pennsylvanian aged sandstone and shale formations. These formations cross MLRA boundaries, and thus, the Leadvale series can be found on Pennsylvanian aged shale and sandstone in MLRA 118a as well as some acreage across the MLRA 119 boundary.  

Map units in Garland, Saline and Boone county were excluded from the initial SDJR harmonization project. They do not conceptually fit with the other map units proposed for harmonization due to differences in geology.

The type location for the Leadvale series is located in Tennessee. The series will need to be re-corrleated in MLRAs 118a/119 in the future. 

****It has been relayed by veteran mappers who are aware of the methodology of the original mapping parties or who were part of initial mapping that, oftentimes, the Leadvale, Guthrie and Taft map units were mapped by use and management, not by geology, MLRA or Taxonomy. It has been relayed that many delineations do not classify correctly in the field. They were mapped based on factors such as depth, water table depth and duration and ""fragipan"" depth. ******



**Later projects will need to separate this map unit based on landform. Toeslopes, terraces and flood plains need to be separated.
There are flooding frequency issues and soil line issues in most counties. It is not uncommon for delineations on terraces to encroach upon flood plains.   Several counties have lesser acreages of the map unit that can be found on inappropriate geological formations, including Cleburne, Jackson, Lonoke, Pulaski and White counties. For example, in Lonoke county, most of the acreage for the map unit is appropriately mapped on the Atoka formation, however, there are also delineations found on Eocene and Paleocene aged formations that could be separated during later field projects.

The Leadvale series is not recognized in Oklahoma, and joins will need to be addressed to add consistency in the future. 

*Roughly 1/3 of the acreage of Leadvale map units in Pulaski County, Ar are found on the wrong type of parent material (much is recent alluvium).

*Delineations of Leadvale can be found on terraces of the AR river in Johnson, Pope, Franklin and Crawford counties. The chemical nature of the soil found on these positions is likely quite different than the series concept. Due to the influence of AR river alluvium, pH is likely outside of the range of the series concept. This notion is supported by lab data from known AR river terrace locations.

**% Organic matter and pH values were aggregated from several lab characterizations for Leadvale from AR.

**Particle size separates were aggregated from several different lab characterizations for Leadvale from AR.

**Depth to perched water table was altered slightly to match horizons

**Ponding frequency/duration for Guthrie component was estimated

**Horizon depth ranges, depth to restrictions were aggregated from TUD pedons.

**KsAT and AWC were derived from table values.

** Component crop yield  and forest productivity were aggregated from historical DMUs.

02/28/2013 00:00:00|"Miscellaneous notes"|"evaluation"|"spatial"|"*A review of the series concept for Leadvale in the manuscript compared to the most current OSD shows that there are no major conceptual differences in soil morphology. The series is set up for Tennessee, and will likely need to be re-corrleated in AR. Many pedon descriptions of Leadvale list a paralithic contact between 60-80 inches, and many do not list a paralithic contact. The series is deep to very deep.


**Leadvale silt loam, 1 -3% slopes, is mapped on multiple landforms in most counties where it is recognized in AR. It can be found on toeslopes, terraces, and flood plains. A project to  compare differences in landform position with differences in soil morphology and split out landforms, is needed. 

*Parent material for the map unit is silty alluvium over residuum of sandstone and shale, or silty pedisediment over residuum, depending on the location of a particular delineation. 

*Commonly, Leadvale silt loam, 1 -3% slopes has delineations that cross multiple landforms, or encroach on adjacent landforms. GIS technology could be used to edit soil lines so that they more accurately follow the land. There are flooding frequency issues and soil line issues in most counties.

Soil surveys included in this mapping are: AR029,   AR033,	AR045,	AR047,	AR067,	AR071,	AR083,	AR105,	AR115,	AR125,	AR129,	AR131,	AR137, AR145,  AR149 and AR640.

The Linker series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum weathered from sandstone. Mountainburg soils are found in areas of this map unit that are shallow to sandstone bedrock.  Enders soils cover small areas of this map unit that have residual shale parent material and are deep to bedrock.  Nella soils cover a few small areas of this mapunit that have colluvium and residuum of sandstone, or shale parent material and are very deep to bedrock.

Future needs for this mapunit include investigations into join problems. The map unit ends abruptly at several county lines.    The Linker series in currently mapped extensively in MLRAs 118a and 117. Further projects will be needed to look at differences in morphology, landscape, elevation and rainfall across the two MLRAs.  There are areas where this mapunit is mapped out of its slope class, and GIS work is needed to tidy up soil polygons that are shifted off of some of the higher mountaintops.

The Mountainburg series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soil that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone.  Enders soils cover small areas of this map unit that have residual shale parent material and are deep to bedrock.  Linker soils cover small areas of this map unit that have loamy residuum weathered from sandstone parent material and are moderately deep to bedrock.  Nella soils cover small areas of this map unit that have alluvium or colluvium residuum of sandstone or shale parent material and are very deep to bedrock.  Rock outcrop covers small areas of this map unit.

Future projects for this map unit include spatial cleanup between counties and to adjust polygons to better fit landforms. A field project is needed to determine fragment content and the surface stoniness modifier.  There needs to be sampling for lab data.  The Mountainburg stony fine sandy loam, 3 to 12 percent slopes in Pulaski county was not included in this project because it has different parent material outside the concept of the Mountainburg series.

This soil is moderately suited to pasture and hayland. Wetness is the main restriction during the winter and early spring. Suitable pasture plants include bermudagrass and tall fescue."|"565820"|"2596547"
|"Nontechnical description"|"SOI"|"043"|"This is a very deep, well drained soil on floodplains of major streams and their tributaries. This soil formed in loamy alluvium. Permeability is moderate and available water capacity is high. Flooding is occasional for brief to long periods during the winter and spring."|"565821"|"2596473"
|"Nontechnical description"|"AGR"|"012"|"This soil is well suited to pasture and hayland, and cultivated crops. Occasional flooding during the late fall, winter, and early spring is a moderate hazard. Suitable crops include corn, soybeans, grain sorghum, and truck crops. Adapted pasture plants include bermudagrass, bahiagrass, tall fescue and white clover."|"565821"|"2596474"

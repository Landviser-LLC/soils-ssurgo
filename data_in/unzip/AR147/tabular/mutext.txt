Mapunit Name - Jackport silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 131A - Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent: MLRA 131A -  level to nearly level soils on Pleistocene terraces in the lower Mississippi Valley.


Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 894 mm to 1456 mm (35 to 57 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 10 to 21 degrees C (50 to 70 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 190 to 260 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting: Jackport soils occur on broad low terraces of the Mississippi delta.  Typically, the surface layer is dark grayish brown, mottled silty clay loam about 5 inches thick.  The subsurface layer is gray, mottled silty clay loam about seven inches thick.  The subsoil is dark grayish brown, silty clay to a depth of about 17 inches, mottled clay to a depth of about 48 inches and olive gray to a depth of about 58 inches. The underlying material is olive gray, mottled silty clay loam that extends to a depth of 72 inches or more.

Major Component: Jackport silty clay


Minor Components:  

Aqualfs - is slightly higher positions


Parent Material: Clayey alluvium (sometimes overlying loamy alluvium)


Typical Vegetation or Crops: Most of the acreage of this soil is used for cropland, mainly soybeans. Other common crops include rice, grain sorghum, and cotton. Fescue is the principal pasture crops. 
 

Mapunit Composition and Reliability: 

Major: Jackport 90%
Minor: aqualfs   10%
	  
	   
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from seven to one.
This mapunit is supported by seven pedon descriptions. These seven pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the seven counties where this mapunit is correlated. 

Classification: FINE, SMECTITIC, THERMIC CHROMIC EPIAQUERTS 


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Jackport series was established in Jackson County, Arkansas in 1941.

Reaction: Very strongly acid to Slightly acid


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The Jackport series is mapped in two different surface phases in Arkansas and misjoins are likely.  The heavier silty clay phase is limited to the northern extent of the range of the series, but flanks the lighter silty clay loam phase in two northern Arkansas counties.


Spatial Data Quality:
Potential mis-joins (surface texture phases) occur at county lines and should be studied as a future project.

Mapunit Name - Amagon silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 131A:  Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in seven counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Craighead (AR031), Cross (AR037), Clay (AR021), Monroe (AR095), Randolph (AR121), Poinsett (AR111) and Woodruff (AR147). The series was established in Calloway County, Kentucky in 1937. The OSD Type Location is in Madison County, Mississippi. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1118 to 1270 mm (44 to 50 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 8.8 to 22.2 degrees C (48 to 72 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 195 to 290 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
The Amagon soils are on low terraces in the Southern Mississippi River Alluvium. 

Minor Component:  
The minor component 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' occur in similar positions as the Amagon soils. The 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' are mostly comprised of Aqualfs (Order: Alfisol; Suborder: Aqualfs). 

Parent Material:
Loamy alluvium

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This soil is suitable for crop production and pastureland. The predominant crops grown on this soil are cotton, soybeans, rice and grain sorghum. Pasture grasses grown include common and improved bermudagrasses and tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Amagon: 90 percent
Unnamed Hydric Soils: 10 percent 
This mapunit is supported by eight pedon descriptions. These eight pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the seven counties where this mapunit is correlated (one of these pedon descriptions is a duplicate). 

Classification:
Amagon classification: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Endoaqualfs 

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Amagon soils in this mapunit consist of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium on low terraces. They have a seasonal water table perched within 12 inches of the surface from December through April in most years. Dominant slope gradients are between 0 and 1 percent. 

Reaction: Reaction is moderately acid through strongly acid in the surface and moderately acid through slightly alkaline in the subsoil.

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Amagon was reviewed for SDJR. 

Spatial Data Quality:
Joins between Arkansas counties will need to be investigated. Spatial distribution is slighlty irregular. An attempt should also be made to join this map unit to Amagon silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (Natl MU Sym: 2pqqq) in Missouri

Mapunit Name - Calhoun silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 134:  Southern Mississippi Valley Loess

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in three counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Greene (AR055), Monroe (AR095) and Woodruff (AR147). The series was established in Calloway County, Kentucky in 1937. The OSD Type Location is in Madison County, Mississippi. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1143 to 1270 mm (45 to 50 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 9.4 to 22.2 degrees C (49 to 72 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 195 to 290 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
The Calhoun soils are on level loess covered stream terraces of Pleistocene Age in the Southern Mississippi Valley Loess. They are poorly drained and have a water at or near the surface during the winter and early spring.

Minor Components:
The Calloway soils are in slightly higher, slightly concave positions on level loess covered stream terraces of Pleistocene Age in the Southern Mississippi Valley Loess. They are somewhat poorly drained and have a seasonally high water table perched over a thick fragipan

The 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' occur in similar positions as Calhoun soils. The 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' are mostly comprised of Aqualfs (Order: Alfisol; Suborder: Aqualfs). 

Parent Material:
Loess

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This soil is suitable for crop production and pastureland. The predominant crops grown on this soil are cotton, soybeans, rice, wheat and grain sorghum. Pasture grasses grown include common and improved bermudagrasses and tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Calhoun: 85 percent
Calloway: 10 percent
Unnamed Hydric Soils: 5 percent 
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. Unnamed Hydric Soils was used as a minor component until field examination can determine a more appropriate composition of minor components. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from three to one.
This mapunit is supported by three pedon descriptions. These three pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the three counties where this mapunit is correlated. 

Classification:
Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Glossaqualfs 


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Calhoun soils in this mapunit consist of level, poorly drained soils that formed in loess deposits on level stream terraces of Pleistocene Age. They have a water table at or near the surface during winter months and early spring. Dominant slope gradients are between 0 and 1 percent.

Reaction: Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid in the surface layer, except where limed or affected by irrigation water; very strongly acid to moderately acid in the subsurface layer and lower part of the subsoil; very strongly acid or strongly acid in the upper part of the subsoil

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Calloway was reviewed for SDJR. 

Spatial Data Quality:
Field work will be required to identify where Calhoun may exist in counties where it is not presently mapped. Currently, spatial distribution is irregular. 

Collaboration will be necessary to join this MLRA map unit with Calhoun silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes in the Missouri bootheel. At the time of this SDJR project the components from Missouri did not warrant inclusion into this project as they differed from the concept around which this project was built.

Mapunit Name - Calloway silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 134:  Southern Mississippi Valley Loess

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in nine counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Craighead (AR031), Cross (AR037), Greene (AR055), Lee (AR077), Monroe (AR095), Phillips (AR107), Poinsett (AR111), St. Francis (AR123) and Woodruff (AR147). The series was established in Calloway County, Kentucky in 1937. The OSD Type Location is in Madison County, Mississippi. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1143 to 1320 mm (45 to 52 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 10 to 21.4 degrees C (50 to 71 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 235 to 295 days
Soil Moisture Class: Udic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
The Calloway soils are on broad, nearly level to gently sloping uplands and stream terraces in the Southern Mississippi Valley Loess. They have a seasonally high water table perched over a thick fragipan. The surface layer is dark grayish brown silt loam. Underneath the surface layer is a yellowish brown layer with light gray clay depletions. Below this layer lies a grayish brown to very pale brown compact and brittle fragipan which perches water.

Minor Components:  
The minor component 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' occur in similar positions, slighlty lower than Calloway soils. The 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' are mostly comprised of Aqualfs (Order: Alfisol; Suborder: Aqualfs). 

Parent Material:
Loess or water re-worked loess deposits

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This soil is suitable for crop production and pastureland. The predominant crops grown on this soil are cotton, soybeans and rice. Other crops include wheat, corn and grain sorghum. Pasture grasses grown include common and improved bermudagrasses and tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Calloway: 90 percent
Unnamed Hydric Soils: 10 percent 
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. Unnamed Hydric Soils as a minor component replaces the Calhoun, Henry, Bonn and Foley series until field examination determines the most appropriate usage of those components. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from nine to one.
This mapunit is supported by sixteen pedon descriptions. These sixteen pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the nine counties where this mapunit is correlated (some of these pedon descriptions are duplicates). 

Classification:
Calloway classification: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Aquic Fraglossudalfs

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Calloway soils in this mapunit consist of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in thick loess or water reworked loess deposits on broad nearly level to gently sloping uplands and stream terraces. They have a seasonally high water table perched over a thick fragipan. Dominant slope gradients are between 0 and 3 percent and range to 5 percent. Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 14 to 38 inches. Black and brown concretions range from few to many in all horizons.The lower part of the solum ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline. Runoff is low to medium and permeability is slow in the fragipan. The soil is saturated in the layers below 1 to 2 feet deep and above the fragipan during January through April in normal years.

Reaction: Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid in the upper part of the solum. The lower part of the solum ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline.

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Calloway was reviewed for SDJR. 

Field work will be required throughout this mapunits distribution to collect pedon descriptions and transects for pedon documentation and minor component composition. There are many minor components listed in the old survey manuscripts. Field work is needed to determine the percentage of these minor components as part of this map unit and to examine the joins between Greene and Clay Counties, Arkansas. The current OSD is described to a depth of 1.5 meters and warrants revision to extend this description to 2 meters, bringing it up to standards of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.

Spatial Data Quality:
Where Greene County joins Clay County warrants more detailed examination.

Mapunit Name - Calloway silt loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes

MLRA 134:  Southern Mississippi Valley Loess

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in eight counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Craighead (AR031), Cross (AR037), Greene (AR055), Lee (AR077), Phillips (AR107), Poinsett (AR111), St. Francis (AR123) and Woodruff (AR147). The series was established in Calloway County, Kentucky in 1937. The OSD Type Location is in Madison County, Mississippi. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1143 to 1320 mm (45 to 52 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 10 to 21.4 degrees C (50 to 71 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 235 to 295 days
Soil Moisture Class: Udic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
The Calloway soils are on broad, nearly level to gently sloping uplands and stream terraces in the Southern Mississippi Valley Loess. They have a seasonally high water table perched over a thick fragipan. The surface layer is dark grayish brown silt loam. Underneath the surface layer is a yellowish brown layer with light gray clay depletions. Below this layer lies a grayish brown to very pale brown compact and brittle fragipan which perches water.

Minor Components:  
The minor component 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' occur in similar positions, slighlty lower than Calloway soils. The 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' are mostly comprised of Aqualfs (Order: Alfisol; Suborder: Aqualfs). 

Parent Material:
Loess or water re-worked loess deposits

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This soil is suitable for crop production and pastureland. The predominant crops grown on this soil are cotton, soybeans and rice. Other crops include wheat, corn and grain sorghum. Pasture grasses grown include common and improved bermudagrasses and tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Calloway: 90 percent
Unnamed Hydric Soils: 10 percent 
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. Unnamed Hydric Soils as a minor component replaces the Calhoun, Henry, Bonn and Foley series until field examination determines the most appropriate usage of those components. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from nine to one.
This mapunit is supported by sixteen pedon descriptions. These sixteen pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the nine counties where this mapunit is correlated (some of these pedon descriptions are duplicates). 

Classification:
Calloway classification: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Aquic Fraglossudalfs

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Calloway soils in this mapunit consist of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in thick loess or water reworked loess deposits on broad nearly level to gently sloping uplands and stream terraces. They have a seasonally high water table perched over a thick fragipan. Dominant slope gradients are between 0 and 3 percent and range to 5 percent. Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 14 to 38 inches. Black and brown concretions range from few to many in all horizons.The lower part of the solum ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline. Runoff is low to medium and permeability is slow in the fragipan. The soil is saturated in the layers below 1 to 2 feet deep and above the fragipan during January through April in normal years.

Reaction: Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid in the upper part of the solum. The lower part of the solum ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline.

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Calloway was reviewed for SDJR. 

Field work will be required throughout this mapunits distribution to collect pedon descriptions and transects for pedon documentation and minor component composition. There are many minor components listed in the old survey manuscripts. Field work is needed to determine the percentage of these minor components as part of this map unit and to examine the joins between Greene and Clay Counties, Arkansas. The current OSD is described to a depth of 1.5 meters and warrants revision to extend this description to 2 meters, bringing it up to standards of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.

Spatial Data Quality:
Where Greene County joins Clay County warrants more detailed examination.

MLRA 131A - Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium

Geographic Extent: These mapping units are level to gently sloping natural levees and low terraces along former channels of the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium Major Land Resource Area; MLRA 131


Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 894 to 1545 mm (35 to 61 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 8.8 to 21.6 degrees C (48 to 71 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 195 to 269 days
Soil Moisture Class: aquic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: level to gently sloping soils on natural levees and low terraces along former channels of the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium Major Land Resource Area


Minor Components: 
Aquents: small narrow drainageways on terrace treads
Amagon: low concave depressions on terrace treads 


Parent Material: loamy alluvium


Typical Vegetation or Crops: row crops - Corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, and wheat. Pasture/hayland crops - tall fescue, improved bermudagrass
 

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Dundee   89%
Amagon    6%
Aquents   5%
 

Classification: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Endoaqualfs 


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations: Typically the surface is Dark grayish brown, friable silt loam; the subsurface is grayish brown friable silt loam; the upper part of the subsoil is grayish brown friable silt loam, the lower subsoil is firm, grayish brown silty clay loam; the lower solum and parent material is friable light grayish brown silt loam. 


Reaction: Surface layer - Extremely acid to moderately except where limed; Subsurface and subsoil layers - very strongly acid to moderately acid; parent material (below solum) very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR: Aquents component does not occur in all mapunit represented in this project. However, most of these mapunits are on very large terrace treads that do have small narrow drainageways that have narrow flood plains, and Amagon would be similar to most aqualf components, thus aquents was chosen to be an RV component.


Spatial Data Quality: Numerous county line joins need to be investigated. Many misjoins are simply slope related.

Mapunit Composition and Reliability: Map unit composition is a composite of the data in the published surveys involved in this project. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from seven to one.  There are seven pedons associated with this project.  These are the Typifying pedons for correlated map unit of the respective surveys.
90% Henry
 5% Aqualfs
 5% Calloway

Classification: Coarse silty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Fragiaqualf


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations: Henry soils are episaturated, having a fragipan layer starting at 18 inches or more.  They are coarse silty and poorly drained.  The parent material is loess.  Typically the surface is dark grayish brown silt loam 5 inches thick; the subsurface is gray silt loam (albic material) to a depth of 25 inches; the upper subsoil (fragipan) is gray silt loam that is firm and brittle to a depth of 60 inches; the lower subsoil is gray silt loam (parent material) to at least 72 inches. 


Reaction: ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid

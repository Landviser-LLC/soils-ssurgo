* Flooding needs to be addressed and water table studies conducted.
* Foot slope soils of Crowleys Ridge need more data for recorrelation.
* Leveled lands need to be investigated.

More pedon data needs to be collected for complete aggregation of all map units.


3) Map Unit Composition.
Transect data need to be collected on all map units for a comprehensive component composition.

County Summary:

* Will update fairly easy.
* Geology breaks need to be made.
* Base saturation studies need to be made as related to geology and map units.
* Map units need finer slope breaks.

5) Field Verification.
* Most of the mapping appears fairly good.
* Slope breaks need refined.
* Series need to be confined geologically.
* Flood plains, stream terraces, toe slopes need the most work.

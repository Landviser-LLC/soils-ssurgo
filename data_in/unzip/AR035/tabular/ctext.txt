03/18/2020 00:00:00|"Nontechnical description"|"GENSOIL"|"generated"|"The Tunica component makes up 85 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. This component is on backswamps, meander belts. The parent material consists of clayey alluvium over loamy alluvium. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is frequently flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 12 inches during January, February, March, April. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 4w.  This soil meets hydric criteria.   "|"23394330"|"24051587"

Mapunit Name - Alligator clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes, rarely flooded, brief duration, west

MLRA131A  Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in four counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Cross (AR037), Lee (AR077), Mississippi (AR093) and Poinsett (AR111). The OSD is located in LeFlore County, MS. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1219 to 1321 mm (48 to 52 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 10 to 21.6 degrees C (50 to 71 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 225 to 290 days
Soil Moisture Class: Udic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
The Alligator soils are in backswamps and on broad flats of the alluvial plains of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. They have a dark grayish brown clay surface layer and a subsoil of light brownish gray to grayish brown clay.

Minor Components:  
The Earle soils are in slightly higher positions, often separating broad flats (or, slack-water areas) from the natural levee and are typically underlain by coarser textured sediments.

The Sharkey soils occupy slightly lower positions in backswamps and on broad flats than the Alligator soils but have a higher pH.

The Tunica soils are in slightly higher positions, often separating broad flats (or, slack-water areas) from the natural levee and are typically underlain by coarser textured sediments.

*Earle soils are more commonly associated with Alligator soils and Tunica soils are more commonly associated with Sharkey soils due to their respective pH levels.

Parent Material:
Clayey alluvium deposited by flooding of the Mississippi River and its tributaries

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This mapunit is used for crop production and pastureland. The typical row crops grown are soybeans and cotton. Other suitable crops include grain sorghum, rice and wheat. Typical pasture grasses grown are Bermuda-grass and tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Alligator: 90 percent
Earle: 5 percent 
Sharkey: 3 percent
Tunica: 2 percent
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. The minor components were altered slightly to more accurately reflect soils on the natural landscape by replacing Aquents with named components commonly associated with Alligator soils. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from four to one.
This mapunit is supported by six pedon descriptions (two of these six pedon descriptions are duplicates). These six pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the four counties where this mapunit is correlated. 

Classification:
Alligator classification: Very-fine, smectitic, thermic Chromic Dystraquerts
The Alligator series was established in 1950 in Quitman County, Mississippi.

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Alligator soils in this mapunit are deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in clayey alluvium of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. They have a high shrink-swell potential and, when dry, have deep wide cracks in the upper part of the soil. Intersecting slickensides are within a depth of 40 inches. This soil is saturated in the surface layer and along cracks and slickenside faces in the subsoil from December through April in normal years.

Reaction: Reaction ranges from strongly acid to very strongly acid in the surface and the upper part of the B horizon. While the lower part of the B horizon commonly ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid, it can range as low as moderately alkaline. Where a C horizon is present, it ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. 

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Alligator was reviewed and updated for SDJR. 

Field work will be required throughout this mapunits distribution to collect pedon descriptions and transects for pedon documentation and minor component percentages as well as sampling to aide in updating classification. There are many minor components listed in the old survey manuscripts (and simply as Aquents in NASIS). The minor components which are listed for multiple counties have been designated as minor components for the MLRA Map Unit. Field work is needed to determine the percentage of these minor components as part of this map unit. The survey manuscripts used to compile the map units that are part of this project are very old (ranging from 1968 to 1977). At that time Alligator was classified as a Vertic Haplaquept. It is now recognized as a Chromic Dystraquert and as such warrants updated pedons (with horizonation assigned from current soil taxonomy).
Many of the Alligator map units that exist have pH RV's in the upper part of the soil that hover around 5.0 (in 1:1 water; a taxonomic requirement for Dystraquerts). Some are above 5.0. Little data exists about the EC of these soils. A study could be conducted to test the EC and pH of the soils of these map units, potentially classifying them as Epiaquerts or Endoaquerts rather than Dystraquerts.


Spatial Data Quality:
Where Poinsett, Cross and Mississippi Counties join Crittenden County, and where Cross and Lee Counties join St. Francis County, joins warrant more detailed examination as many of the map units stop 'cold' at county lines. 

This map unit warrants review of flooding phases as it is mapped in both the protected and unprotected sides of the St. Francis River levee system. It is believed that mapping was done prior to installation of the levee system.

Mapunit Name - Amagon silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 131A:  Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in seven counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Craighead (AR031), Cross (AR037), Clay (AR021), Monroe (AR095), Randolph (AR121), Poinsett (AR111) and Woodruff (AR147). The series was established in Calloway County, Kentucky in 1937. The OSD Type Location is in Madison County, Mississippi. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1118 to 1270 mm (44 to 50 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 8.8 to 22.2 degrees C (48 to 72 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 195 to 290 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
The Amagon soils are on low terraces in the Southern Mississippi River Alluvium. 

Minor Component:  
The minor component 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' occur in similar positions as the Amagon soils. The 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' are mostly comprised of Aqualfs (Order: Alfisol; Suborder: Aqualfs). 

Parent Material:
Loamy alluvium

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This soil is suitable for crop production and pastureland. The predominant crops grown on this soil are cotton, soybeans, rice and grain sorghum. Pasture grasses grown include common and improved bermudagrasses and tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Amagon: 90 percent
Unnamed Hydric Soils: 10 percent 
This mapunit is supported by eight pedon descriptions. These eight pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the seven counties where this mapunit is correlated (one of these pedon descriptions is a duplicate). 

Classification:
Amagon classification: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Endoaqualfs 

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Amagon soils in this mapunit consist of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium on low terraces. They have a seasonal water table perched within 12 inches of the surface from December through April in most years. Dominant slope gradients are between 0 and 1 percent. 

Reaction: Reaction is moderately acid through strongly acid in the surface and moderately acid through slightly alkaline in the subsoil.

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Amagon was reviewed for SDJR. 

Spatial Data Quality:
Joins between Arkansas counties will need to be investigated. Spatial distribution is slighlty irregular. An attempt should also be made to join this map unit to Amagon silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (Natl MU Sym: 2pqqq) in Missouri

Mapunit Name - Calloway silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 134:  Southern Mississippi Valley Loess

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in nine counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Craighead (AR031), Cross (AR037), Greene (AR055), Lee (AR077), Monroe (AR095), Phillips (AR107), Poinsett (AR111), St. Francis (AR123) and Woodruff (AR147). The series was established in Calloway County, Kentucky in 1937. The OSD Type Location is in Madison County, Mississippi. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1143 to 1320 mm (45 to 52 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 10 to 21.4 degrees C (50 to 71 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 235 to 295 days
Soil Moisture Class: Udic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
The Calloway soils are on broad, nearly level to gently sloping uplands and stream terraces in the Southern Mississippi Valley Loess. They have a seasonally high water table perched over a thick fragipan. The surface layer is dark grayish brown silt loam. Underneath the surface layer is a yellowish brown layer with light gray clay depletions. Below this layer lies a grayish brown to very pale brown compact and brittle fragipan which perches water.

Minor Components:  
The minor component 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' occur in similar positions, slighlty lower than Calloway soils. The 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' are mostly comprised of Aqualfs (Order: Alfisol; Suborder: Aqualfs). 

Parent Material:
Loess or water re-worked loess deposits

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This soil is suitable for crop production and pastureland. The predominant crops grown on this soil are cotton, soybeans and rice. Other crops include wheat, corn and grain sorghum. Pasture grasses grown include common and improved bermudagrasses and tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Calloway: 90 percent
Unnamed Hydric Soils: 10 percent 
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. Unnamed Hydric Soils as a minor component replaces the Calhoun, Henry, Bonn and Foley series until field examination determines the most appropriate usage of those components. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from nine to one.
This mapunit is supported by sixteen pedon descriptions. These sixteen pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the nine counties where this mapunit is correlated (some of these pedon descriptions are duplicates). 

Classification:
Calloway classification: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Aquic Fraglossudalfs

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Calloway soils in this mapunit consist of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in thick loess or water reworked loess deposits on broad nearly level to gently sloping uplands and stream terraces. They have a seasonally high water table perched over a thick fragipan. Dominant slope gradients are between 0 and 3 percent and range to 5 percent. Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 14 to 38 inches. Black and brown concretions range from few to many in all horizons.The lower part of the solum ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline. Runoff is low to medium and permeability is slow in the fragipan. The soil is saturated in the layers below 1 to 2 feet deep and above the fragipan during January through April in normal years.

Reaction: Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid in the upper part of the solum. The lower part of the solum ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline.

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Calloway was reviewed for SDJR. 

Field work will be required throughout this mapunits distribution to collect pedon descriptions and transects for pedon documentation and minor component composition. There are many minor components listed in the old survey manuscripts. Field work is needed to determine the percentage of these minor components as part of this map unit and to examine the joins between Greene and Clay Counties, Arkansas. The current OSD is described to a depth of 1.5 meters and warrants revision to extend this description to 2 meters, bringing it up to standards of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.

Spatial Data Quality:
Where Greene County joins Clay County warrants more detailed examination.

These counties are Craighead (AR031), Cross (AR037), Greene (AR055), Lee (AR077), Phillips (AR107), Poinsett (AR111), St. Francis (AR123) and Woodruff (AR147). The series was established in Calloway County, Kentucky in 1937. The OSD Type Location is in Madison County, Mississippi. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1143 to 1320 mm (45 to 52 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 10 to 21.4 degrees C (50 to 71 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 235 to 295 days
Soil Moisture Class: Udic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
The Calloway soils are on broad, nearly level to gently sloping uplands and stream terraces in the Southern Mississippi Valley Loess. They have a seasonally high water table perched over a thick fragipan. The surface layer is dark grayish brown silt loam. Underneath the surface layer is a yellowish brown layer with light gray clay depletions. Below this layer lies a grayish brown to very pale brown compact and brittle fragipan which perches water.

Minor Components:  
The minor component 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' occur in similar positions, slighlty lower than Calloway soils. The 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' are mostly comprised of Aqualfs (Order: Alfisol; Suborder: Aqualfs). 

Parent Material:
Loess or water re-worked loess deposits

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This soil is suitable for crop production and pastureland. The predominant crops grown on this soil are cotton, soybeans and rice. Other crops include wheat, corn and grain sorghum. Pasture grasses grown include common and improved bermudagrasses and tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Calloway: 90 percent
Unnamed Hydric Soils: 10 percent 
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. Unnamed Hydric Soils as a minor component replaces the Calhoun, Henry, Bonn and Foley series until field examination determines the most appropriate usage of those components. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from nine to one.
This mapunit is supported by sixteen pedon descriptions. These sixteen pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the nine counties where this mapunit is correlated (some of these pedon descriptions are duplicates). 

Classification:
Calloway classification: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Aquic Fraglossudalfs

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Calloway soils in this mapunit consist of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in thick loess or water reworked loess deposits on broad nearly level to gently sloping uplands and stream terraces. They have a seasonally high water table perched over a thick fragipan. Dominant slope gradients are between 0 and 3 percent and range to 5 percent. Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 14 to 38 inches. Black and brown concretions range from few to many in all horizons.The lower part of the solum ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline. Runoff is low to medium and permeability is slow in the fragipan. The soil is saturated in the layers below 1 to 2 feet deep and above the fragipan during January through April in normal years.

Reaction: Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid in the upper part of the solum. The lower part of the solum ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline.

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Calloway was reviewed for SDJR. 

Field work will be required throughout this mapunits distribution to collect pedon descriptions and transects for pedon documentation and minor component composition. There are many minor components listed in the old survey manuscripts. Field work is needed to determine the percentage of these minor components as part of this map unit and to examine the joins between Greene and Clay Counties, Arkansas. The current OSD is described to a depth of 1.5 meters and warrants revision to extend this description to 2 meters, bringing it up to standards of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.

Spatial Data Quality:
Where Greene County joins Clay County warrants more detailed examination.

Seasonal wetness and flooding are the main limitations for these uses."|"564420"|"2592248"

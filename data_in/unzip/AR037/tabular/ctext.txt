These surveys were all published between 1968 and 1977. The Alligator map units contained therein were classified as Vertic Haplaquepts and therefore do not express the degree of soil development we know Alligator soils to have today as they are currently classified (Chromic Dystraquerts). Upon evaluation of these manuscripts and the pedon descriptions they contain, horizons that were previously denoted as B21g are now recognized as Bg horizons. Horizons denoted as B22g through C1g, if slickensides are mentioned in the pedon descriptions, are now recognized as Bssg horizons."|"23394465"|"24052768"

State soil scientist strongly prefers that the cropland yield and woodland performance data be populated in the new MRLA MU/DMU with the understanding that a future project is needed to investigate and update the data. 

There was a group teleconference phone call on 3-28-14 with SSS (Delaney Johnson) and the Asst. SSS (James Curtis) about this and then an email to summarize recommendations.  

Rachel,

Per our conversation concerning woodland productivity being adjusted or corrected in the database to meet a requirement identified through QA, we recommend leaving the data population. We do prefer to make like DMU data- the elements and values the same throughout respective MLRA. This may be done by selecting the survey area, which has the most reliable data, and use as the standard or baseline and match other soil survey areas within MLRA.
I would like for you to make an MLRA-wide data set and keep the tables in the database.

Thanks,

Delaney

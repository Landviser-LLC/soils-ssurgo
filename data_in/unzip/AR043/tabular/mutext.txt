Summary of Published Manuscript Map Unit Descriptions 
(Summarize findings from map unit description in surveys. Main items that need to be summarized are: composition and minor components, landscape, landform and positions of major and minor components, erosion hazards, and major land use. This is not an all-inclusive list and other items should be added as needed. Input of all items must be kept in a format that will transfer to plain text without a loss of intended organization. Delete this paragraph and use headings listed below)
Composition:
Amy soils are 85 percent of the map unit based on map unit descriptions in the manuscripts and NASIS data population.
Minor Components:
 Leadvale, Pheba, and Aquults, are the minor components listed in the manuscripts and NASIS. Percentages for individual minor components were not listed in the manuscript. Minor components were not named in some surveys.  All of this data will be used to assign estimated percentages to the mlra mapunit components.
Landscape, Landform and Positions for Components:
Amy:       Landform: Stream Terraces
                Landscape: valleys
Aquults:  Landform: Depressions

Describe Differences Between MLRA Map Unit and Map Units Being Harmonized:
Describe the differences between map units and the harmonized unit
Very little inconsistencies exist in the populated horizon data. The main differences are in the MAP, MAAT. The unit is mapped in an area with tight temperature and moisture gradients. 
The runoff, drainage classes, and component soil moisture tables do not match, and therefore neither do the soil interpretations that use these properties and qualities.

Lab Data:
(List pedon IDs, if there is no lab data or lab data is inadequate, identify the need for a future mlra update project)
KSSL  No KSSL Lab Data for Amy Series One pedon sampled in TX297. S95TX297000

Local  Fourteen pedons with local lab data exist. 

Pedon Data in NASIS:
(Statement of the amount and distribution of pedon data. Give numbers of pedons and transects, not a list of pedon IDs. If the distribution of pedon data is unrepresentative of the map unit range, say so. For example:)
There are no known transect data associated with this project. There are 15 pedons currently in NASIS of the Amy series.

Other Attribute Issues:
	Costal Plain Soil
	Established in Pulaski County, Arkansas
	Hydric Soil
	Mainly found in Arkansas
	Formed during the Pleistocence Era

Future Project Needs: 
	Gather Transect/Pedon Data of Amy silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes to get an accurate assessment of the mapunit composition.
	Sample Amy to send to Lincoln for KSSL Data
	Develop Monolith of Amy for Display and Educational Purposes

Join Issues:

Spatial Data Quality: 
(If any are known, just make a statement about which counties have spatial data problems prompted by answering the questions at the bottom.  Such as map units that may be combined with this unit or extent is too large and needs to be refined. Also certain areas may need to be changed to a different series or split into two map units. Example:)
Slope Analysis: 
No spatial analysis was conducted.
Future Project Needs:
Some extensive revision of soil survey delineations is needed and the correction over the map unit extent of any glaring cartographic errors.

Classification: fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludults
Type Location: Wilcox County, AL
Established: 1908, Henry County, AL.
Acres:  30949
Geology: coastal plain sediments 
Slope: 1 to 3 percent
Surface texture: fine sandy loam
The Cahaba series consist of deep well drained soils. These gently to very gently sloping soils formed in loamy and sandy fluviatile sediments that contained appreciable amounts of silt.
This map unit is supported by 3 pedon descriptions. The 3 pedon descriptions in NASIS are the representative pedons (TUDs) for the correlated map units in their respective counties/parishes. The number of pedons in NASIS are not sufficient for the number of correlated acres; therefore, a future field project is needed to collect additional data and transects. 
Lab Data: none 
University Lab Data:none
Local: none
Ecological Site ID: F133BY013TX
Field Projects Needed:
	Collect field data-Pedon & Transect descriptions throughout map unit distribution, for documentation, so that range of characteristics are adequate.
	Collect lab sample for analysis
	Collect pedon descriptions for minor component percentages and naming
	Evaluate and update productivity ratings to align with modern day practices
	Evaluate spatial data, and realign polygons to fit where they are supposed to be in the world
	Work with ESD Specialist to develop sites for map unit and update ESD.

This is a future MLRA project that was identified and documented during the processing of the Evaluation project name: MLRA 133B- Grenada silt loam, 3 to 8 percent slopes
This project was developed to address those correlated map units of Grenada silt loam, 3 to 8 percent slopes within 9-RUS area of responsibility.
Amy
Classification: fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Oxyaquic Fraglossudalfs
Type Location: Grenada County, MS
Established: 1915, Grenada County, MS.
Acres:  54257
Geology: coastal plain sediments 
Slope: 3 to 8 percent
Surface texture: silt loam
The Grenada series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in thick loess. These soils are shallow or moderately deep to a fragipan that perches water during wet seasons in late winter and early in spring. This map unit is supported by 3 pedon descriptions. The 3 pedon descriptions in NASIS are the representative pedons (TUDs) for the correlated map units in their respective counties/parishes. The number of pedons in NASIS are not sufficient for the number of correlated acres; therefore, a future field project is needed to collect additional data and transects. 
Lab Data: none 
Local: none
Ecological Site ID: F131DY004AR
Field Projects Needed:
	Collect field data-Pedon & Transect descriptions throughout map unit distribution, for documentation, so that range of characteristics are adequate.
	Collect lab sample for analysis
	Collect pedon descriptions for minor component percentages and naming
	Evaluate and update productivity ratings to align with modern day practices
	Evaluate spatial data, and realign polygons to fit where they are supposed to be in the world
	Work with ESD Specialist to develop sites for map unit and update ESD.

Summary of published manuscript Map Unit Descriptions 
Hebert silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes is currently mapped in eleven soil surveys thru out the 9-PNB MLRA region. The Map Unit Descriptions in each of these surveys were all fairly consistent with one another concerning this map unit. Cropland use was the majority land use for this map unit and this map unit was found along natural levee systems thru out this MLRA. There were some degree of variations among the minor components of this map unit. Rilla, Gallion, Perry, and Portland soils were the most common minor components found in the each map unit description. The Land capability class was either a 2w or 2w5 thru out all of the surveys.

Summary of Published Manuscript Map Unit Descriptions 

Composition:
 Pheba soils are 85 percent of the map unit based on map unit descriptions in the manuscripts and NASIS data population.
Minor Components:
Amy, Aquults, and Guyton, are the minor components listed in the manuscripts and NASIS. Percentages for individual minor components were not listed in the manuscript. Minor components were not named in some surveys.  All of this data will be used to assign estimated percentages to the mlra mapunit components.
Landscape, Landform and Positions for Components:
Major Land Uses:
About 90 percent  cropland , 10 percent forrested and less than 1 percent Urbanland
Additional items

Describe Differences Between MLRA Map Unit and Map Units Being Harmonized:

Very little data inconsistencies exist . 
Lab Data:
(List pedon IDs, if there is no lab data or lab data is inadequate, identify the need for a future mlra update project)
KSSL  No Lab Data Available for any of the counties in the 9-PNB region, currently all Pheba KSSL data is from Mississippi which not apart of this SDJR project.
Local  Eight pedons with local lab data exist, four of the eight pedon are within the 9-PNB region.

Pedon Data in NASIS:
There are 18 pedons of Pheba in NASIS 5 of the eighteen stems from a RaCA site in Louisana,  12  are TPs from  Mississippi and 1 from Arkansas. One pedon in NASIS is from the 9-PNB region.

Other Attribute Issues:


Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes is mapped in four counites within the 9-PNB region. The Soil Series Pheba is established in Clay Mississippi.  This map unit lies within the Western Coastal Plain regions of the MLRA. Pheba is in a taxonomic family all of its own.


Future Project Needs: 
Future Project: Gather transect and pedon for Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes.   
Future Project Needs: Determine if the Pheba that is mapped in 9-PNB is really Pheba or if should be correlated into another series or a new series has be developed. Reason for this study is due to the fact that Pheba is established in Clay County, MS and the series sporadically delineated throughout the 7 MET, 9-RUS to 9-PNB.
Future Project Needs: Conduct Ksat study ot Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 % slopes to have hard data from the 9-PNB region. 
Future Project Need: Look at Joins Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 percent have crossing into counties/parishes that do not have Pheba mapped.

Evaluation of map unit interpretations (subcategory interpretation)

Interpretation Join Issues:
No major Interpretation Join Issues were identified with harmonizing of Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes.


Evaluation of the map unit delineations (subcategory spatial)

Join Issues:
Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes have join issues where the map unit crosses from Ashley County, Arkansas to Morehouse Parish, Louisana. Morehouse Parish,LA doesnt have Pheba mapped in the county, but Pheba coming in from Ashley County, Arkansas. Also Pheba that is mapped in Dallas/Calhoun County, Arkansas comes into Cleveland County, Arkansas where Pheba isnt mapped in Cleveland County, Ark. Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes from Jefferson/Lincoln County, Arkansas comes into Cleveland County, Arkansas where Pheba isnt in Cleveland County, Arkansas.
Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes coming from Jefferson County, Arkansas coming into Grant County, Arkansas. Grant County, Ark.

Spatial Data Quality: 
Currently no known spatial issues are identified.

Slope Analysis: 
No spatial analysis was conducted.
Future Project Needs:
Some extensive revision of soil survey delineations is needed and the correction over the map unit extent of any glaring cartographic errors.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Floodplain ecological site has clay-textured, very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils that are prone to flooding. Sites can flood for prolonged periods, especially during the winter and early spring.

Soil Features
The ecological site consists of very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained, very slowly permeable to impermeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium. The soils have high clay content with high shrink-swell potential. Soils correlated to this site include: Alligator, Desha, Forestdale, Perry, and Portland.

Reference Community
Besides the co-dominants overcup oak and water hickory, associate species may include: green ash, hackberry (Celtis laevigata), swamp dogwood (Cornus foemina), and swamp privet (Forestiera acuminata). Buttonbush is a common understory shrub. Sedges and other herbaceous vegetation adapted to seasonally prolonged flooding inhabit the forest understory.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Floodplain ecological site has loamy-textured, very deep, somewhat poorly to well drained soils that are prone to flooding. Sites can flood for prolonged periods, especially during the winter and early spring. 

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, somewhat poorly to well drained, very slow to moderately permeable soils. Most of the soils have a silt loam surface, but can range from very fine sandy loam to silty clay loam. Soils correlated to this site include: Caspiana, Commerce, Coushatta, Dardanelle, Gallion, Hebert, Keo, Mcgehee, Mer Rouge, Morganfield, Norwood, Oklared, Rilla, Roxana, Severn, and Sterlington.

Reference Community
Besides the co-dominants water oak and willow oak, associate species may include: sweetgum, Nuttall oak, overcup oak (Quercus lyrata), hackberry (Celtis laevigata), green ash, and red maple. Understory shrub species include: swamp dogwood (Cornus foemina), green hawthorn (Crataegus viridis), and possumhaw (Ilex decidua). Common understory herbaceous species include: peppervine (Ampelopsis arborea), trumpet-creeper (Campsis radicans), and poison ivy. Sedges and other herbaceous vegetation adapted to seasonally prolonged flooding inhabit the forest understory.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Floodplain ecological site has loamy-textured, very deep, somewhat poorly to well drained soils that are prone to flooding. Sites can flood for prolonged periods, especially during the winter and early spring. 

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, somewhat poorly to well drained, very slow to moderately permeable soils. Most of the soils have a silt loam surface, but can range from very fine sandy loam to silty clay loam. Soils correlated to this site include: Caspiana, Commerce, Coushatta, Dardanelle, Gallion, Hebert, Keo, Mcgehee, Mer Rouge, Morganfield, Norwood, Oklared, Rilla, Roxana, Severn, and Sterlington.

Reference Community
Besides the co-dominants water oak and willow oak, associate species may include: sweetgum, Nuttall oak, overcup oak (Quercus lyrata), hackberry (Celtis laevigata), green ash, and red maple. Understory shrub species include: swamp dogwood (Cornus foemina), green hawthorn (Crataegus viridis), and possumhaw (Ilex decidua). Common understory herbaceous species include: peppervine (Ampelopsis arborea), trumpet-creeper (Campsis radicans), and poison ivy. Sedges and other herbaceous vegetation adapted to seasonally prolonged flooding inhabit the forest understory.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Floodplain ecological site has clay-textured, very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils that are prone to flooding. Sites can flood for prolonged periods, especially during the winter and early spring.

Soil Features
The ecological site consists of very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained, very slowly permeable to impermeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium. The soils have high clay content with high shrink-swell potential. Soils correlated to this site include: Alligator, Desha, Forestdale, Perry, and Portland.

Reference Community
Besides the co-dominants overcup oak and water hickory, associate species may include: green ash, hackberry (Celtis laevigata), swamp dogwood (Cornus foemina), and swamp privet (Forestiera acuminata). Buttonbush is a common understory shrub. Sedges and other herbaceous vegetation adapted to seasonally prolonged flooding inhabit the forest understory.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Floodplain ecological site has clay-textured, very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils that are prone to flooding. Sites can flood for prolonged periods, especially during the winter and early spring.

Soil Features
The ecological site consists of very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained, very slowly permeable to impermeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium. The soils have high clay content with high shrink-swell potential. Soils correlated to this site include: Alligator, Desha, Forestdale, Perry, and Portland.

Reference Community
Besides the co-dominants overcup oak and water hickory, associate species may include: green ash, hackberry (Celtis laevigata), swamp dogwood (Cornus foemina), and swamp privet (Forestiera acuminata). Buttonbush is a common understory shrub. Sedges and other herbaceous vegetation adapted to seasonally prolonged flooding inhabit the forest understory.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Floodplain ecological site has clay-textured, very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils that are prone to flooding. Sites can flood for prolonged periods, especially during the winter and early spring.

Soil Features
The ecological site consists of very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained, very slowly permeable to impermeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium. The soils have high clay content with high shrink-swell potential. Soils correlated to this site include: Alligator, Desha, Forestdale, Perry, and Portland.

Reference Community
Besides the co-dominants overcup oak and water hickory, associate species may include: green ash, hackberry (Celtis laevigata), swamp dogwood (Cornus foemina), and swamp privet (Forestiera acuminata). Buttonbush is a common understory shrub. Sedges and other herbaceous vegetation adapted to seasonally prolonged flooding inhabit the forest understory.

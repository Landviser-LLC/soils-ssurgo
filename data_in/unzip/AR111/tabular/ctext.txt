Well drained and drier components with RV slopes containing a "".5"" were rounded up and Moderately Well Drained and wetter soils containing a "".5"" were rounded down.  "|"23399100"|"24094271"

This component is on flats on Mississippi River alluvial plains. The parent material consists of clayey alluvium. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is moderate.  Shrink-swell potential is very high. This soil is rarely flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 0 inches during January, February, March, April, November, December. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 3w.  This soil meets hydric criteria.   "|"23399060"|"24093833"

These surveys were all published between 1968 and 1977. The Alligator map units contained therein were classified as Vertic Haplaquepts and therefore do not express the degree of soil development we know Alligator soils to have today as they are currently classified (Chromic Dystraquerts). Upon evaluation of these manuscripts and the pedon descriptions they contain, horizons that were previously denoted as B21g are now recognized as Bg horizons. Horizons denoted as B22g through C1g, if slickensides are mentioned in the pedon descriptions, are now recognized as Bssg horizons."|"23399060"|"24093832"

* More pedon data needs to be collected for complete aggregation of all map units.


3) Map Unit Composition.
* Transect data need to be collected on all map units for a comprehensive component composition.

County Summary:
* Will update fairly easy.
* Geology breaks need to be made.
* Base saturation studies need to be made as related to geology and map units.
* Map units need finer slope breaks.

02/23/2009 00:00:00|"Miscellaneous notes"|"evaluation"|"interpretation"|"1) Known Deficiencies.
* Flooding needs to be addressed and water table studies conducted.
* All large scarp slopes on terraces need to have a line feature added or a polygon feature added if large enough.
* Leveled lands need to be investigated.
* Foot slope soil units along Crowleys Ridge need to be reevaluated.
* Bosket in the western lowlands does appear to be Mollic.
* Water table studies need to be conducted on all geomorphic landforms.

7)  The Soil-Landscape Model.
* Jackport:Poorly drained, level mostly clayey soils on broad flats
* Tichnor:Poorly drained, level, loamy soils on flood plains
* Henry-Hillemann-Calloway:Poorly drained and somewhat poorly drained, level and nearly level loamy soils on uplands
* Falaya-collins:Somewhat poorly drained and moderately well drained, level loamy soils on flood plains
* Loring-Bradon-Memphis:Moderately well drained and well drained, gently sloping to steep loamy soils on uplands
* Mhoon-Dundee:Poorly drained and somewhat poorly drained, level and nearly level loamy soils on natural levees
* Sharkey:Poorly drained, level clayey soils on frequently flooded depressed parts of slack-water areas
* Tunica-Sharkey:Poorly drained, level and undulating clayey soils in slack water areas
* Sharkey-Alligator:Poorly drained. Level clayey soils in slack-water areas"|"15132"|"78979"
02/23/2009 00:00:00|"Miscellaneous notes"|"evaluation"|"spatial"|"4) GIS Evaluation of Line Placement.
* MMA boundary needs adjusting, the ridge is split and does not follow a physiographic landform
* Jacksport has ponded areas
* Jacksports has areas of different shades and depressional areas to be cut out
* Water needs adjusting
* New water needs delineating
* Levees need delineating
* Hillemann may cross slope classes
* Henry has depressional areas and ponded
* Some water needs to be widen and changed to orthents water complex
* Henry may cross slope classes
* Large area of water is not water in woods may have been flooded
* Some ridge tops could be delineated
* Some areas of hills needs adjusting
* Loring on ridge tops and on footslopes
* Sharkey clays have depressional areas and shade differences


5) Field Verification.
* Most of the mapping appears fairly good.
* Slope breaks need refined.
* Series need to be confined geologically.
* Flood plains, stream terraces, toe slopes need the most work.

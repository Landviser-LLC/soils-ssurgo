Mapunit Name - Alligator clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes, rarely flooded, brief duration, west

MLRA131A  Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in four counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Cross (AR037), Lee (AR077), Mississippi (AR093) and Poinsett (AR111). The OSD is located in LeFlore County, MS. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1219 to 1321 mm (48 to 52 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 10 to 21.6 degrees C (50 to 71 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 225 to 290 days
Soil Moisture Class: Udic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
The Alligator soils are in backswamps and on broad flats of the alluvial plains of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. They have a dark grayish brown clay surface layer and a subsoil of light brownish gray to grayish brown clay.

Minor Components:  
The Earle soils are in slightly higher positions, often separating broad flats (or, slack-water areas) from the natural levee and are typically underlain by coarser textured sediments.

The Sharkey soils occupy slightly lower positions in backswamps and on broad flats than the Alligator soils but have a higher pH.

The Tunica soils are in slightly higher positions, often separating broad flats (or, slack-water areas) from the natural levee and are typically underlain by coarser textured sediments.

*Earle soils are more commonly associated with Alligator soils and Tunica soils are more commonly associated with Sharkey soils due to their respective pH levels.

Parent Material:
Clayey alluvium deposited by flooding of the Mississippi River and its tributaries

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This mapunit is used for crop production and pastureland. The typical row crops grown are soybeans and cotton. Other suitable crops include grain sorghum, rice and wheat. Typical pasture grasses grown are Bermuda-grass and tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Alligator: 90 percent
Earle: 5 percent 
Sharkey: 3 percent
Tunica: 2 percent
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. The minor components were altered slightly to more accurately reflect soils on the natural landscape by replacing Aquents with named components commonly associated with Alligator soils. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from four to one.
This mapunit is supported by six pedon descriptions (two of these six pedon descriptions are duplicates). These six pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the four counties where this mapunit is correlated. 

Classification:
Alligator classification: Very-fine, smectitic, thermic Chromic Dystraquerts
The Alligator series was established in 1950 in Quitman County, Mississippi.

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Alligator soils in this mapunit are deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in clayey alluvium of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. They have a high shrink-swell potential and, when dry, have deep wide cracks in the upper part of the soil. Intersecting slickensides are within a depth of 40 inches. This soil is saturated in the surface layer and along cracks and slickenside faces in the subsoil from December through April in normal years.

Reaction: Reaction ranges from strongly acid to very strongly acid in the surface and the upper part of the B horizon. While the lower part of the B horizon commonly ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid, it can range as low as moderately alkaline. Where a C horizon is present, it ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. 

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Alligator was reviewed and updated for SDJR. 

Field work will be required throughout this mapunits distribution to collect pedon descriptions and transects for pedon documentation and minor component percentages as well as sampling to aide in updating classification. There are many minor components listed in the old survey manuscripts (and simply as Aquents in NASIS). The minor components which are listed for multiple counties have been designated as minor components for the MLRA Map Unit. Field work is needed to determine the percentage of these minor components as part of this map unit. The survey manuscripts used to compile the map units that are part of this project are very old (ranging from 1968 to 1977). At that time Alligator was classified as a Vertic Haplaquept. It is now recognized as a Chromic Dystraquert and as such warrants updated pedons (with horizonation assigned from current soil taxonomy).
Many of the Alligator map units that exist have pH RV's in the upper part of the soil that hover around 5.0 (in 1:1 water; a taxonomic requirement for Dystraquerts). Some are above 5.0. Little data exists about the EC of these soils. A study could be conducted to test the EC and pH of the soils of these map units, potentially classifying them as Epiaquerts or Endoaquerts rather than Dystraquerts.


Spatial Data Quality:
Where Poinsett, Cross and Mississippi Counties join Crittenden County, and where Cross and Lee Counties join St. Francis County, joins warrant more detailed examination as many of the map units stop 'cold' at county lines. 

This map unit warrants review of flooding phases as it is mapped in both the protected and unprotected sides of the St. Francis River levee system. It is believed that mapping was done prior to installation of the levee system.

Mapunit Name - Amagon silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 131A:  Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in seven counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Craighead (AR031), Cross (AR037), Clay (AR021), Monroe (AR095), Randolph (AR121), Poinsett (AR111) and Woodruff (AR147). The series was established in Calloway County, Kentucky in 1937. The OSD Type Location is in Madison County, Mississippi. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1118 to 1270 mm (44 to 50 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 8.8 to 22.2 degrees C (48 to 72 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 195 to 290 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
The Amagon soils are on low terraces in the Southern Mississippi River Alluvium. 

Minor Component:  
The minor component 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' occur in similar positions as the Amagon soils. The 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' are mostly comprised of Aqualfs (Order: Alfisol; Suborder: Aqualfs). 

Parent Material:
Loamy alluvium

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This soil is suitable for crop production and pastureland. The predominant crops grown on this soil are cotton, soybeans, rice and grain sorghum. Pasture grasses grown include common and improved bermudagrasses and tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Amagon: 90 percent
Unnamed Hydric Soils: 10 percent 
This mapunit is supported by eight pedon descriptions. These eight pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the seven counties where this mapunit is correlated (one of these pedon descriptions is a duplicate). 

Classification:
Amagon classification: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Endoaqualfs 

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Amagon soils in this mapunit consist of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium on low terraces. They have a seasonal water table perched within 12 inches of the surface from December through April in most years. Dominant slope gradients are between 0 and 1 percent. 

Reaction: Reaction is moderately acid through strongly acid in the surface and moderately acid through slightly alkaline in the subsoil.

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Amagon was reviewed for SDJR. 

Spatial Data Quality:
Joins between Arkansas counties will need to be investigated. Spatial distribution is slighlty irregular. An attempt should also be made to join this map unit to Amagon silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (Natl MU Sym: 2pqqq) in Missouri

Mapunit Name - Calloway silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 134:  Southern Mississippi Valley Loess

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in nine counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Craighead (AR031), Cross (AR037), Greene (AR055), Lee (AR077), Monroe (AR095), Phillips (AR107), Poinsett (AR111), St. Francis (AR123) and Woodruff (AR147). The series was established in Calloway County, Kentucky in 1937. The OSD Type Location is in Madison County, Mississippi. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1143 to 1320 mm (45 to 52 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 10 to 21.4 degrees C (50 to 71 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 235 to 295 days
Soil Moisture Class: Udic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
The Calloway soils are on broad, nearly level to gently sloping uplands and stream terraces in the Southern Mississippi Valley Loess. They have a seasonally high water table perched over a thick fragipan. The surface layer is dark grayish brown silt loam. Underneath the surface layer is a yellowish brown layer with light gray clay depletions. Below this layer lies a grayish brown to very pale brown compact and brittle fragipan which perches water.

Minor Components:  
The minor component 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' occur in similar positions, slighlty lower than Calloway soils. The 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' are mostly comprised of Aqualfs (Order: Alfisol; Suborder: Aqualfs). 

Parent Material:
Loess or water re-worked loess deposits

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This soil is suitable for crop production and pastureland. The predominant crops grown on this soil are cotton, soybeans and rice. Other crops include wheat, corn and grain sorghum. Pasture grasses grown include common and improved bermudagrasses and tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Calloway: 90 percent
Unnamed Hydric Soils: 10 percent 
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. Unnamed Hydric Soils as a minor component replaces the Calhoun, Henry, Bonn and Foley series until field examination determines the most appropriate usage of those components. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from nine to one.
This mapunit is supported by sixteen pedon descriptions. These sixteen pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the nine counties where this mapunit is correlated (some of these pedon descriptions are duplicates). 

Classification:
Calloway classification: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Aquic Fraglossudalfs

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Calloway soils in this mapunit consist of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in thick loess or water reworked loess deposits on broad nearly level to gently sloping uplands and stream terraces. They have a seasonally high water table perched over a thick fragipan. Dominant slope gradients are between 0 and 3 percent and range to 5 percent. Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 14 to 38 inches. Black and brown concretions range from few to many in all horizons.The lower part of the solum ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline. Runoff is low to medium and permeability is slow in the fragipan. The soil is saturated in the layers below 1 to 2 feet deep and above the fragipan during January through April in normal years.

Reaction: Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid in the upper part of the solum. The lower part of the solum ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline.

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Calloway was reviewed for SDJR. 

Field work will be required throughout this mapunits distribution to collect pedon descriptions and transects for pedon documentation and minor component composition. There are many minor components listed in the old survey manuscripts. Field work is needed to determine the percentage of these minor components as part of this map unit and to examine the joins between Greene and Clay Counties, Arkansas. The current OSD is described to a depth of 1.5 meters and warrants revision to extend this description to 2 meters, bringing it up to standards of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.

Spatial Data Quality:
Where Greene County joins Clay County warrants more detailed examination.

Mapunit Name  Collins silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, occasionally flooded, brief duration

MLRA 134:  Southern Mississippi Valley Loess

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in three counties in Arkansas and one county in Missouri.  These counties are Clay County, AR (AR021), Craighaed County, AR (AR031), and Poinsett County, AR (AR111) and Stoddard County, MO (MO207). The OSD is located in Craighead County, AR. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 977 to 1385 mm (38.5 to 54.5 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 7.8 to 20.0 degrees C (46 to 68 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 193 to 242 days
Taxonomic Soil Moisture Class: Udic

Geographic Setting: 

Major Component: 
The Collins series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils. They formed in silty alluvium on flood plains of streams in the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands Major Land Resource Area. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.

Minor Components:  

Aquents soils are in slightly lower positions on the flood plain. They are deep, well drained, and moderately permeable.  The surface layer is brown or dark yellowish brown silt loam and the subsoil is yellowish brown and brown silt loam.


Parent Material:
Coarse-silty alluvium washed from loess covered uplands

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
Most areas of this mapunit are used for crop production. The main crop is soybeans. Some areas are used for corn, pasture, or hay. A few areas support hardwoods. Other suitable crops include grain sorghum and water-tolerant grasses, such as tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Collins: 94 percent
Aquents: 6 percent 
The mapunit composition was determined from a review of the manuscripts of Clay, Craighead, and Poinsett Counties, Arkansas, and from Stoddard County, MO. and from knowledge of those landscapes and soils. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from four to one.
This mapunit is supported by four pedon descriptions.  The Collins pedons are the typifying pedons from the four counties where this mapunit is correlated. 

Classification:
Major Component:
Collins classification: Coarse-silty, mixed, active, acid, thermic Aquic Udifluvents
The Collins series was established in 1906 in Prairie County, Arkansas.
Minor Components:
Aquents - only classified to the family level


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
Collins soils are very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils. They formed in silty alluvium on flood plains of streams in the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands Major Land Resource Area. They have a high available water holding capacity, medium natural fertility and range from strongly acid to very strongly acid in all horizons. These soils flood occasionally, usually for several days at a time in the winter and spring, and the water table stays at a depth of 2 feet or more during this time period. The rooting zone is deep during the summer months but is somewhat restricted by the water table during the winter and spring months. 

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The Official Series Description for Collins was reviewed for SDJR. No revisions were needed.

Future work on this map unit will be needed. As with all flood plain map units, further evaluation is needed of spatial joins across state and county boundaries.  Additionally, the exact content of the Aquents component should be investigated to try to put a series name on it.

Spatial Data Quality:
An evaluation of joins is needed between where this map unit exists and the adjoining counties/states. Possible mis-joins would relate to differences in slope class, flooding frequency, and flooding duration are possible. "|"564267"|"2601799"

Mapunit Name  Falaya silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, occasionally flooded, brief duration

MLRA 134  Southern Mississippi Valley Loess

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in five counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Clay (AR021), Craighead (AR031), Greene (AR055), Lee (AR077) and Poinsett (AR111). The OSD is located in Fayette County, TN. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1118 to 1295 mm (44 to 51 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 9.7 to 21.4 degrees C (48 to 71 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 211 to 295 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
The Falaya soils are on flood plains. They have a layer in which the dominant colors have a chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 20 inches. The surface layer is brown silt loam and the subsoil ranges from light brownish gray to gray silt loam. 

Minor Components:  
'Unnamed Hydric Soils' are in similar positions on flood plains. 

Parent Material:
Coarse-silty alluvium washed from loess covered uplands

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
Most areas of this mapunit are used for crop production. Suitable crops include soybeans, corn, cotton, grain sorghum. This soil is also suited for pasture, or hay. Suitable forage crops include bermudagrass and tall fescue. A few areas support hardwoods. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Falaya: 95 percent
Unnamed Hydric Soils: 5 percent 
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions of those map units around which this SDJR project was centered. The minor component 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' was used until such time that minor component composition can be investigated more thoroughly in the field. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from five to one.
This mapunit is supported by six pedon descriptions. These six pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the two counties where this mapunit is correlated (one of which is a duplicate). 


Classification:
Major Component:
Falaya classification: Coarse-silty, mixed, active, acid, thermic Aeric Fluvaquents
The Falaya series was established in 1950 in Quitman County, Mississippi.

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Falaya soils in this mapunit are deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils formed in coarse-silty alluvium washed from loess covered uplands. They have a high available water holding capacity, medium natural fertility and range from strongly acid to very strongly acid. These soils flood occasionally, usually for several days at a time in the winter and spring, and the water table stays at a depth of 1 to 2 feet during this time period. The rooting zone is deep during the summer months but is restricted by the water table during the winter and spring months. This soil is not suited to most urban uses because of the susceptibility to flooding and the seasonal high water table.


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The Official Series Description for Falaya was reviewed for SDJR. No revisions were needed.


Spatial Data Quality:
An evaluation of joins is needed in Cross and St. Francis Counties, AR. This map unit will eventually need to be joined with the Falaya silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, occasionally flooded map units in Missouri.

Grain crops such as: soybeans, wheat, and rice
Other crops: Cotton

Mapunit Composition and Reliability (l,rv,h):
Foley: 50-60-90
Calhoun: 10-30-34


Classification:
Foley: FOLEY FINE-SILTY, MIXED, ACTIVE, THERMIC ALBIC GLOSSIC NATRAQUALFS 
Calhoun: CALHOUN FINE-SILTY, MIXED, ACTIVE, THERMIC TYPIC GLOSSAQUALFS 
Lafe: LAFE FINE-SILTY, MIXED, ACTIVE, THERMIC GLOSSAQUIC NATRUDALFS 


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:  
Foley soils:  Typically the surface is Dark grayish brown, friable silt loam; the subsurface is grayish brown friable silt loam; the upper part of the subsoil is made up of distinct areas of friable, gray brown silt loam with tounges of gray and grayish brown silt loam; the middle part is firm, olive gray silty clay loam; the lower part is firm, olive gray silt loam.

Calhoun soils: Typically the surface is friable dark grayish brown silt loam; the subsurface is friable, gray silt loam; the upper part of the subsoil is friable, gray silt loam with tounges of gray silt loam from the subsurface; the middle part is firm, grayish brown  silty clay loam; the lower part is friable, gray silt loam.



This unit is moderately suited to agriculture.  Excess water can be a severe hazard; Planting times can be delayed unless surface drainage is provided.  High sodium content in the Foley and Lafe components is also a severe limitation. 


Reaction: extremely acid to mildly alkaline


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR: Historically, the Aqualfs component was included to add a hydric component to the map unit.  At some point this needs to be investigated and a series substituted.

Mapunit Name - Foley silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 131A - Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent: The Foley series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in silty material high in sodium. These level to nearly level soils are on terraces in the Lower Mississippi Valley; MLRA 131. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.


Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1118 to 1219 mm (44 to 48 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 9.9 to 21.3 degrees C (48 to 70 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 225 to 265 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting: Nearly level soils are on terrace treads in the Lower Mississippi Valley; MLRA 131. 


Major Component: Foley


Minor Components: Aqualfs 


Parent Material: Silty alluvium that is high is sodium


Typical Vegetation or Crops: Row crops including soybean, wheat, rice, cotton, and some pasture/hayland including bermuda grass and fescue.
 

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:

Foley: 95%
Aqualfs: 5% 

Classification: Fine silty, mixed, active, thermic Albic Glossic Natraqualfs 


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations: Typically the surface is Dark grayish brown, friable silt loam; the subsurface is grayish brown friable silt loam; the upper part of the subsoil is made up of distinct areas of firm, gray silt loam and very fine sandy loam; the middle part is firm, gray silty clay loam; the lower part is friable olive gray silt loam. 

Reaction: very strongly acid in the surface and subsurface, strongly acid to strongly alkaline in the subsoil


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR: Historically, the Aqualfs component was included to add a hydric component to the map unit.  At some point this needs to be investigated and a series substituted.


Spatial Data Quality:  Good. Gaps in distribution exist and should be investigated.

Mapunit Name - Jackport silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 131A - Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent: MLRA 131A -  level to nearly level soils on Pleistocene terraces in the lower Mississippi Valley.


Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 894 mm to 1456 mm (35 to 57 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 10 to 21 degrees C (50 to 70 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 190 to 260 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting: Jackport soils occur on broad low terraces of the Mississippi delta.  Typically, the surface layer is dark grayish brown, mottled silty clay loam about 5 inches thick.  The subsurface layer is gray, mottled silty clay loam about seven inches thick.  The subsoil is dark grayish brown, silty clay to a depth of about 17 inches, mottled clay to a depth of about 48 inches and olive gray to a depth of about 58 inches. The underlying material is olive gray, mottled silty clay loam that extends to a depth of 72 inches or more.

Major Component: Jackport silty clay


Minor Components:  

Aqualfs - is slightly higher positions


Parent Material: Clayey alluvium (sometimes overlying loamy alluvium)


Typical Vegetation or Crops: Most of the acreage of this soil is used for cropland, mainly soybeans. Other common crops include rice, grain sorghum, and cotton. Fescue is the principal pasture crops. 
 

Mapunit Composition and Reliability: 

Major: Jackport 90%
Minor: aqualfs   10%
	  
	   
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from seven to one.
This mapunit is supported by seven pedon descriptions. These seven pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the seven counties where this mapunit is correlated. 

Classification: FINE, SMECTITIC, THERMIC CHROMIC EPIAQUERTS 


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Jackport series was established in Jackson County, Arkansas in 1941.

Reaction: Very strongly acid to Slightly acid


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The Jackport series is mapped in two different surface phases in Arkansas and misjoins are likely.  The heavier silty clay phase is limited to the northern extent of the range of the series, but flanks the lighter silty clay loam phase in two northern Arkansas counties.


Spatial Data Quality:
Potential mis-joins (surface texture phases) occur at county lines and should be studied as a future project.

Use and Management
Major land uses: Cropland, Forestland  
Cropland
Careful selection and application of chemicals and fertilizers can minimize 
contamination of ground water.
Clods can form if the soil is tilled when wet.
Compaction can be minimized by controlling traffic.
The rooting depth is restricted by the very high content of clay.
Maintaining or increasing the content of organic matter in the soil helps to prevent
crusting, improves tilth, and increases the rate of water infiltration.
A subsurface drainage system can help to lower the seasonal high water table. The
movement of water into the subsurface drains, however, is restricted. Drainage
guides can be used to determine the spacing requirements for tile.
Including deep-rooted cover crops in the rotation improves soil structure and
provides pathways in the clayey subsoil, thereby facilitating the movement of water
into subsurface drains.
Pastureland
Excess water should be removed, or species of grasses or legumes that are
adapted to wet soil conditions should be grown.
Compaction can be minimized by restricting grazing during wet periods.
Forestland
The seasonal high water table can restrict root respiration, thereby inhibiting the
growth of some species of seedlings.
Because of the low strength of the soil, ruts may form, resulting in unsafe conditions
and damage to equipment.
Wetness in the soil can limit the use logging trucks.
Because of the content of clay, this soil becomes sticky when wet. The stickiness
increases the cost of constructing haul roads and log landings, reduces the
efficiency of mechanical planting equipment, and restricts the use of equipment for
site preparation to the drier periods.
Building sites
This soil is generally unsuited to building site development. It is subject to rare
flooding under unusual weather conditions. The flooding can result in physical
damage and costly repairs to buildings. Special design of structures, including farm
outbuildings, may be needed to avoid the damage.
In some areas, the high content of clay in the subsoil increases the difficulty of
digging, filling, and compacting the soil material in shallow excavations.
Septic tank absorption fields
Because of the seasonal high water table, this soil is generally unsuitable as a site
for septic tank absorption fields.
Flooding limits the absorption and proper treatment of effluent from septic systems.
Rapidly moving floodwater can damage some components of septic systems.
Local roads and streets
Because of shrinking and swelling, this soil may not be suitable as base material for
local roads and streets.
The seasonal high water table affects the ease of excavation and grading and limits
the load-bearing capacity of the soil.
Roads and bridges need special design to avoid the damage caused by flooding.

Major Component: 

Sharkey, Steele

Minor Components:  

Mhoon, Hayti

Parent Material: Sharkey: clayey alluvium, Steele: clayey alluvium with loamy to sandy overwash


Typical Vegetation or Crops: row crops such as cotton, soybeans, and wheat.  Also, some pasture and hayland (bermuda grass, fescue). 
 

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
 
Sharkey: 60% 
Steele: 30%
Mhoon: 5%
Hayti: 5%

Classification: 

Sharkey: Very fine, smetitic, thermic, Chromic Epiaquerts
Steele: Sandy over clayey, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermis Aquic Udifluvents


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations: (Sharkey) The construction of levees along the Mississippi River and its tributaries along with the installation of an intricate network of regional, local and field drains to remove surface water has altered the hydrology of Sharkey and other soils in the valley. These soils are now saturated only in the upper part of the surface layer, and along cracks and slickenside faces in the subsoil from December through April in normal years. The soils are reduced in the upper part of the surface horizon and have positive reaction to alpha,alpha-dipyridyl solution during periods when water is on the surface. The surface is very dark grayish brown clay, 7 inches deep; the upper subsoil is dark gray clay; the lower subsoil is dark gray 26 inches or more thick. (Steele) The surface is grayish brown loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand (overwash) 6 to 10 inches thick; the subsurface is pale brown, loamy fine sand about 2 inches thick; the upper subsoil is grayish brown, loamy fine sand 20 inches thick; the lower subsoil (discontinuity) is gray clay, more than 46 inches thick. 
 



Reaction: Sharkey: medium acid to neutral, Steele: strongly acid to neutral


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR: Steele soils are essentially deep overwashes of such soils as Hayti, Cooter, and Sharkey but cannot be considered as overwash phases since the thickness is more than 20 inches.

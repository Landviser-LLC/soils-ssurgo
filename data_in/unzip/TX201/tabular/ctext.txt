Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
 The central concept of this site is somewhat isolated from salt water intrusion. The salinity ranges are never high but there is some salinity in the soil that will manifest itself during periods of dry weather. The best indicator plant on this site is seashore Paspalum. Lesser amounts of California bulrush, Olney bulrush, softstem bulrush, marshhay cordgrass, spikesedges, seedbox, Colorado River hemp, and cattails are also found. Elevation, drainage, salinity, water depth, and duration play a major role in the vegetation. Small areas of open water are also included. These areas are important to waterfowl and other wildlife because habitat diversity. Water salinity level varies throughout the year. Fresher water is indicated by the presence of narrowleaf cattail, seedbox, whorled pennywort, and softstem bulrush.

Soil Features
The soil series in this site concept are Barnett, Harris, Ijam & Leerco. They are very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable firm mineral soils that formed in mineral sediments of Coastal Marshes. Surface runoff and internal drainage are lacking. The soil is permanently saturated to the surface. The soils can support the weight of livestock.

Ecological Site Concept
Tidal Flats are areas adjacent to the bay where marshes ebb and flow with water as a result of tide phases.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep and very poorly drained that formed in saline loamy alluvium or eolian coastal deposits. The soils have very slow permeability, strong salinity, and strong sodicity with a neutral through moderately alkaline soil reaction. Soils exhibit halic soil properties along with a peraquic moisture regime. An organic mat of decomposing plant material can be found 1 to 8 inches thick on the surface. Soils correlated to this site include: Follet, Karankawa, Rahal, Tatlum, and Tracosa.

Reference Community
Smooth cordgrass dominates this community. Smooth cordgrass is adapted to high salinity soils with tidal inundation, wave action, and occasional burial. Average depth of water at high tide ranges from 2 to 12 inches and salinity varies from 12 to 50 parts per thousand, though rainfall may lower salinity. Subdominant grass species include marshhay cordgrass and inland saltgrass (Distichlis spicata). Salt-tolerant forbs such as glassworts and saltworts (Salicornia spp and Batis spp.) may occupy interspaces between cordgrass bunches. This is a highly resilient community and well adapted to storm impacts. Typical recovery time from tropical storms and mild hurricanes is about a year. The site is relatively grazing tolerant due to the low palatability of mature cordgrass. Lack of grazing combined with high resiliency has resulted in many remnant reference sites. Burning is an option to remove rank vegetation, increase palatability, and diversity of plants.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is an open grassland with gulf cordgrass, little bluestem, seacoast bluestem, switchgrass, Hartweg's paspalum, seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), marshhay cordgrass, and traces of bushy sea oxeye (Borrichia frutescens). Variations in salinity and soil moisture cause local variations in the plant community, particularly along streams. Studies have shown that length and amount of inundation, and fresh or saltwater runoff have a controlling influence on the post-inundation plant community. Heavy grazing pressure will quickly depress little/seacoast bluestem and lead to a dominance of gulf cordgrass. Inundation with salt water may also cause little/seacoast bluestem to disappear for 2 to 3 years post-inundation. A lengthy inundation with fresh or brackish water may cause the post-inundation community to be dominated by gulf cordgrass.

Reference Community
The Brackish Firm Mineral Marsh ecological site can potentially support a somewhat diverse mixture of grasses, grass-like plants, and forbs. Marshhay cordgrass is the dominant species in this plant community and is the plant that management considerations are based on. Marshhay cordgrass is typically found where salinity levels are between 3 and 9 ppt and water depth is up to 6 inches. Secondary herbaceous vegetation is directly influenced by factors such as elevation, water depth, and salinity. Variations in one or more of these factors can result in the plant community shifting back and forth from species that are typically associated with more saline conditions to species that are generally associated with fresh marsh. Seashore paspalum, Olney bulrush (three-corner grass), saltmarsh bulrush (leafy three-square) and California bulrush (bullwhip) are the most significant sub-dominant species. Seashore saltgrass is usually found in the small drainageways within the site. It can withstand more saline conditions and longer periods of inundation than marshhay cordgrass. Low growing and sod-forming grasses and grass-like plants such as dwarf spikerush, and fragrant flatsedge are minor components of this plant community. Roseau cane (common reed) occurs in areas that are fresher or slightly elevated. The primary forbs found on this site are cattail, saltmarsh morningglory, and saltmarsh mallow. Widgeongrass is a submerged aquatic species that is typically found in open water areas within the brackish marsh and is an excellent duck food. Shrubs are rare to non-existent on this site in its pristine state, however a few widely scattered shrubs may occur. Those shrubby species may include bigleaf sumpweed (marsh elder), eastern baccharis, and wolfberry. Fire is a major mangaement tool for this plant community. Without fire the accumulated rough of marshhay cordgrass not only suppresses other vegetation, but it can also reduce its own annual production because the old growth suppresses the potential for new, vigorous growth. Prescribed fire allows species such as dwarf spikerush and seashore saltgrass to increase both spatially and in biomass production.

Ecological Site Concept
Salt Marshes are closed depressions of the inland Coastal Plains exhibiting salt-tolerant vegetation.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, saline, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. Tidal influence and salty substrates produce saline to brackish conditions. However, at any given location, the degree of salinity is a result of the local interaction of tidal influence, freshwater inflows, and substrate salt content. This site has an Aquic soil moisture regime with gleyed colors throughout the profile. Other features include moderate to strong sodicity and neutral to strong alkalinity. Soil correlated to this site include: Harris, Placedo, Swan, and Velasco.

Reference Community
The reference community is a mixture of mid and tallgrasses making up greater than 80 percent of the biomass. Dominant grasses include marshhay cordgrass (Spartina patens), common reed (Phragmites australis), and seashore dropseed (Sporobolus virginicus). Interstitial graminoids include shoregrass (Monanthochloe littoralis), seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum), and bulrushes (Scirpus spp.). Forbs include dwarf glasswort (Salicornia virginica), sea lavender (Limonium carolinianum), and seacoast sumpweed (Iva annua). Shrubs and half-shrubs are generally sparse in this community, but if present may include sea oxeye (Borrichia frutescens) and wolfberry (Lycium carolinianum). Smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), and saltmarsh bulrush (Bolboschoenus robustus) occur on the more saline areas. Fresher parts of the site are indicated by the presence of Common reed, big cordgrass (Spartina cynosuroides), and seashore paspalum. Shifts in composition may occur due to changes in the water and/or salinity regimes or in response to grazing impacts. Any of these sets of factors may produce similar vegetation responses and thus careful assessment must be made to determine the cause of observed changes. Many of the graminoids become coarse and unpalatable at maturity and fire can be used to stimulate new, more palatable growth and increase production. Improper grazing can cause a decrease in cordgrass, seashore dropseed, and common reed. When they are grazed frequently, they will be eliminated from the site because their root system is unable to recover. When the desirable plants have decreased, less desirable plants such as inland saltgrass and smooth cordgrass start to increase. Cordgrasses and other plants within this community primary reproduce vegetatively by rhizomes, which makes this site very resilient to disturbance. However, once they are eliminated they are hard to reestablish. Reseeding is not an option for this site because most of the seeds from these species are sterile. To reestablish these species transplanting or bringing in rhizomes are possible options for reestablishment. Unwanted species are limited due to the high salinity in the soil. Plants that are intolerant of salt are controlled with a tidal surge or hurricanes.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Prairie has very deep sandy soils on uplands. The sands are generally greater than 20 inches deep before reaching a sandy clay loam subsurface horizon.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained, very slowly to moderately rapidly permeable soils. The surface is typically loamy fine sand. Generally, the soils are taxonomically classified as Arenic, but other classifications may be present. The argillic horizon textures range from fine sandy loam to clay loam. Argillic horizons exhibit redoximorphic features and even include plinthite in some pedons. A perched water table on top of the argillic can result following periods of heavy rain events. Soils correlated to this site include: Cheetham, Fordtran, Garcitas, Milby, and Monaville.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a tall/midgrass prairie. It is a fire-maintained, bunchgrass prairie composed of primarily warm-season, tall and midgrasses with a few warm-season perennial forbs and cool-season grasses and forbs. Recurrent fire, primarily during the summers and periodic grazing by bison were natural processes, which maintained this plant community. Under continuous, heavy livestock grazing the taller, more palatable bunchgrasses such as big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, Florida paspalum, and switchgrass decrease and are replaced by mid and shortgrasses. Subsequently, with the resulting reduced fuel loads, fire frequency and intensity decreased. As the process continued, these plants were replaced by even less palatable, less productive midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile. Runoff is low and erosion is negligible.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam ecological site typically has a fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam surface. Sandy clay loam subsoil horizons are generally present 15 to 18 inches below the surface.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, moderately well or well drained, with very slow or slow permeability. Other features consist of moderately acid to neutral soil reaction. The dominant surface texture is fine sandy loam with some inclusions of loamy fine sand. Diagnostic features and horizons include an ochric epipedon and argillic horizon. A representative ochric epipedon ranges from 5 to 10 inches thick. Some pedons exhibit vertic properties in the argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Blanconia, Copano, Fulshear, Inez, and Morales.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent grassland composed primarily of tallgrasses and midgrasses that make up to 70 percent of the composition. Forbs make up 5 percent of the composition and woody shrubs, mainly yaupon, American beautyberry, and dewberry (Rubus spp.), comprise 5 percent of the composition. Trees, consisting of either live oak or post oak, dominate the small mottes found on the site. An occasional American elm or hackberry may be found in the tree mix. Productivity is very high and litter accumulates covering approximately 60 to 75 percent. Crusting does not occur on the soil surface and bare ground is less than 10 percent. Native legumes occur in relatively high numbers. Continuous grazing with excessive livestock numbers has had a major impact on the vegetation. The reduction in grass volume also reduces the incidence of wildfires allowing woody seedlings to escape fire and grow large enough to become fire tolerant. Moreover, as overgrazing continues, the more palatable tallgrasses are replaced by less desirable grasses. Basal densities of grass species will decline as does ground litter. Bare ground increases, as does annual production of annual forbs. Soil erosion is not a problem due to the flatness of the landscape. Once the woody invaders to this site such as mesquite, huisache and/or McCartney Rose seedlings appear in small numbers, the window of opportunity to control these plants before they become a serious problem is only very few years. Once the threshold of 15 percent canopy cover is surpassed, control requires a significant amount of resources in time, energy and money to restore the grassland.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

The sandy and loamy soils drain water quickly from the site, but their proximity to flood-prone waterways creates a unique mixture of plant species. The plants are adapted to withstand flooding and dryness because of the rapid permeability.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, moderately well drained and well drained soils formed from sandy sediments and loamy alluvium. Hatliff and Voss are the representative series and are classified as a coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Fluventic Dystrudept and a mixed, thermic, Oxyaquic Udipsamment, respectively. As with soils that are entisols and inceptisols, extensive horizon development has not occurred. The horizons are generally separated by a change in color as their textures are similar throughout the entire profile. The subsurface is saturated for at least 20 consecutive days, or 30 cumulative days throughout the year.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine and American beech. Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and water oak (Quercus nigra) are common and an occasional swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii) will be mixed in. Shrub species can vary, but American hornbeam is prolific, with eastern baccharis (Baccharis halimifolia) and witchhazel (Hamamelis virginiana) mixed in. Since the overstory canopy is somewhat closed, grass and forb species can be sparse. Thick stands of switchcane and broadleaf uniola will be present nearest the waterway where more sunlight exists. These species also stabilize the soil with their roots.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Prairie has very deep sandy soils on uplands. The sands are generally greater than 20 inches deep before reaching a sandy clay loam subsurface horizon.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained, very slowly to moderately rapidly permeable soils. The surface is typically loamy fine sand. Generally, the soils are taxonomically classified as Arenic, but other classifications may be present. The argillic horizon textures range from fine sandy loam to clay loam. Argillic horizons exhibit redoximorphic features and even include plinthite in some pedons. A perched water table on top of the argillic can result following periods of heavy rain events. Soils correlated to this site include: Cheetham, Fordtran, Garcitas, Milby, and Monaville.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a tall/midgrass prairie. It is a fire-maintained, bunchgrass prairie composed of primarily warm-season, tall and midgrasses with a few warm-season perennial forbs and cool-season grasses and forbs. Recurrent fire, primarily during the summers and periodic grazing by bison were natural processes, which maintained this plant community. Under continuous, heavy livestock grazing the taller, more palatable bunchgrasses such as big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, Florida paspalum, and switchgrass decrease and are replaced by mid and shortgrasses. Subsequently, with the resulting reduced fuel loads, fire frequency and intensity decreased. As the process continued, these plants were replaced by even less palatable, less productive midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs.

Ecological Site Concept
The sites are characterized by a sandy surface layer that extends 20 to 40 inches to a loamy subsurface layer. The sites are more productive and less droughty than soils with deeper sands, but not as productive as soils with a higher clay content.

Soil Features
The soils are deep to very deep, fine sands and loamy fine sands with a surface 20 to 40 inches thick over loamy subsoils. Water soaks rapidly into the open soils. Even light showers penetrate below the evaporation zone and are more effective on this site than sites with deeper sands. Water retention is relatively low but the soils give up a high percent of their moisture to growing plants. Although air, water, and plant roots move through the soil with ease, frequent rains are needed to produce optimum plant growth. Inherent low fertility causes these soils to produce forage of lower quantity than associated sites with higher clay content. The site is subject to erosion where adequate herbaceous cover is not maintained and on heavy use areas such as roads and livestock trails. Soils correlated to this site include: Demona, Dutek, Newulm, Nimrod, Rehburg, Robco, Silstid, and Styx.

Reference Community
The characteristic plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is an open savannah of post oak and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) trees that shade 20 to 25 percent of the ground. The herbaceous component is mid and tallgrasses and is dominated by little bluestem which usually makes up 50 to 75 percent of the total annual production. Indiangrass, purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus), switchgrass, beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), sand lovegrass (Eragrostis trichodes), brownseed paspalum (Paspalum plicatulum), and thin paspalum (Paspalum setaceum) also occur. Cool season forage plants are scarce on this site. A variety of shrubs, vines, and forbs occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every five to seven years are important in the maintenance of the reference herbaceous plant community and the savannah landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing or over rest and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species. Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to the Shrubland State.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile. Runoff is low and erosion is negligible. Soils correlated to this site include: Addicks, Algoa, Anahuac, Chesterville, Cyfair, Hockley, Katy, Kemah, Labelle, Levac, Meaton, Mocarey, Mockley, Morey, Orcadia, Spindletop, Viterbo, Winnie, Wockley, and Yeaton.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly to very poorly drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative series are Bissonnet, Caddo, Camptown, Evadale, Jasco, Kinder, Olive, Sorter, Tyden, and Waller. Since so many soils belong to this ecological site, their taxonomies vary, but all belong to the orders of alfisols and ultisols.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Flat ecological site has very deep, poorly drained soils influenced by the shrink-swell properties of the clay content. The soils of this site are vertisols, meaning the soils move with moisture content. Their flat landform and shrink-swell clay properties couple to form their plant community.

Soil Features
The soils of this site consist of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in clayey fluviomarine deposits. The soils typically have clay-textured horizons through the entire profile. Soils within this ecological site include Bevil, Vamont, and Vidrine, which are Chromic Dystraquerts, Oxyaquic Dystruderts, and Aquic Glossudalfs, respectively. Bevil and Vamont belong to the vertisol order because of their vertic properties. This refers to the lower, subsurface profiles, having shrink-swell properties. The soil shrinks and swells depending on moisture content and leaves large cracks on the surface when dry. The clay material in Vidrine is not quite as active, but is included in the Clayey Flats because of the similar landform position and horizon profile.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy consists of several hardwoods species. Swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michaeux) is frequently dominant and willow oak (Quercus phellos) is highly prevalent. Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), water oak (Quercus nigra), and cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda) are often found associated on the site. Dense cover of dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor) is an indicator of the Clayey Flats. Other species found in midstory are arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua). The herbaceous understory varies depending on overstory and midstory densities. Longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum) and broadleaf uniola (Chasmanthium latifolium) are especially common because of their high tolerance to shady conditions.

The representative series are Bissonnet, Caddo, Camptown, Evadale, Jasco, Kinder, Olive, Sorter, Tyden, and Waller. Since so many soils belong to this ecological site, their taxonomies vary, but all belong to the orders of alfisols and ultisols. The soils extend throughout the whole region and are widely prolific.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine, with longleaf pine as a co-dominant. Other species such as sweetgum (Liquidambar straciflua), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica) may be present, but not in large numbers. The midstory and understory vary significantly, especially with time since last fire. An herbaceous understory will be found directly after a burn and more shrub species will be present as the time since fire lengthens. Common midstory shrubs and trees include wax myrtle (Morella cerifera), dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and redbay (Persea borbonia). Understory species include a variety of sedges (Carex sp.), flatsedges (Cyperus sp.), rushes (Juncus sp.), spikerushes (Eleocharis sp.), and fimbry (Fimbristylis sp.). The presence of spikerushes is oftentimes an indicator of the site. Lizards tail (Saururus cernuus) is the most prolific forb species.

Ecological Site Concept
The Terrace ecological site has very deep soils on terrace landforms. These sites are located on a higher landform than bottomlands and are not as wet. The sites are situated on a lower landform than the uplands and are not as dry. The sites do not flood or pond, but instead have a water table from December to April. This unique position between the drier uplands and wetter bottomlands creates their plant community.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, well drained to poorly drained soils formed from alluvium. The representative soils are Acadia, Belrose, Kenefick, Spurger, and Votaw. They are widely varying taxonomically, from entisols to alfisols to ultisols. Their unifying factor is their terrace position. They are on lower landscape positions than uplands and on higher landscape positions than bottomlands.

The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine with intermingled white oak (Quercus alba). Other species commonly found mixed in the overstory are longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and water oak (Quercus nigra). The midstory shrub and tree species can be thick or sparse, depending on time since last fire. American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria) can be extremely dense as the length since last fire increases. Flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) is a conspicuous indicator species, especially late March through early May when blooming. The herbaceous understory is dense and filled with little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), needleleaf rosettegrass (Dichanthelium aciculare), and western brackenfern (Pteridium aquilinum). Summer grapes (Vitis aestivalis) are also very common throughout the site.

The Clayey Flat ecological site has very deep, poorly drained soils influenced by the shrink-swell properties of the clay content. The soils of this site are vertisols, meaning the soils move with moisture content. Their flat landform and shrink-swell clay properties couple to form their plant community.

Soil Features
The soils of this site consist of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in clayey fluviomarine deposits. The soils typically have clay-textured horizons through the entire profile. Soils within this ecological site include Bevil, Vamont, and Vidrine, which are Chromic Dystraquerts, Oxyaquic Dystruderts, and Aquic Glossudalfs, respectively. Bevil and Vamont belong to the vertisol order because of their vertic properties. This refers to the lower, subsurface profiles, having shrink-swell properties. The soil shrinks and swells depending on moisture content and leaves large cracks on the surface when dry. The clay material in Vidrine is not quite as active, but is included in the Clayey Flats because of the similar landform position and horizon profile.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy consists of several hardwoods species. Swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michaeux) is frequently dominant and willow oak (Quercus phellos) is highly prevalent. Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), water oak (Quercus nigra), and cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda) are often found associated on the site. Dense cover of dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor) is an indicator of the Clayey Flats. Other species found in midstory are arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua). The herbaceous understory varies depending on overstory and midstory densities. Longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum) and broadleaf uniola (Chasmanthium latifolium) are especially common because of their high tolerance to shady conditions.

Ecological Site Concept
The Well Drained Bottomland ecological site has well drained soils in bottomlands found adjacent to waterways. The sandy and loamy soils drain water quickly from the site, but their proximity to flood-prone waterways creates a unique mixture of plant species. The plants are adapted to withstand flooding and dryness because of the rapid permeability.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, moderately well drained and well drained soils formed from sandy sediments and loamy alluvium. Hatliff and Voss are the representative series and are classified as a coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Fluventic Dystrudept and a mixed, thermic, Oxyaquic Udipsamment, respectively. As with soils that are entisols and inceptisols, extensive horizon development has not occurred. The horizons are generally separated by a change in color as their textures are similar throughout the entire profile. The subsurface is saturated for at least 20 consecutive days, or 30 cumulative days throughout the year.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine and American beech. Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and water oak (Quercus nigra) are common and an occasional swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii) will be mixed in. Shrub species can vary, but American hornbeam is prolific, with eastern baccharis (Baccharis halimifolia) and witchhazel (Hamamelis virginiana) mixed in. Since the overstory canopy is somewhat closed, grass and forb species can be sparse. Thick stands of switchcane and broadleaf uniola will be present nearest the waterway where more sunlight exists. These species also stabilize the soil with their roots.

Ecological Site Concept
The Swamp ecological site has very deep, very poorly drained soils greater than 80 inches (203 centimeters) that are ponded throughout a portion of the year. A wetland plant community exists because it is the lowest position on the landscape, along with the flooding and ponding regimes.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by gleyed horizons throughout the entire soil profile, measured to 80 inches (203 centimeters). The gleying, or grey soil color, is a result of anaerobic conditions from the soils being saturated for long periods. The soils show little soil development indicative of the entisols soil order. The surface layer is darkest and the underlying subsoil layers are mostly distinguished by color and exhibit more hydric soil features besides gleying. Iron-manganese masses, oxidized root channels, and other indicators of anoxic conditions are evident. The Cowmarsh series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvial deposits of the Holocene age. The series is classified as a fine, smectitic, acid, thermic Typic Fluvaqeunt. Other soils are included within the ecological site have the same influencing water features and support hydrophytic vegetation. Besides the Cowmarsh series, Deweyville is included in the Swamp ecological site.

Reference Community
The vegetation that has adapted to the anaerobic conditions are dominant. The United State Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) classifies plants that occur in wetlands with an estimated probability greater than 99 percent obligate (OBL), and those 67 to 99 percent facultative wetland (FACW) plants. Obligate and facultative wetland plants are the most common encountered throughout the Swamps. When submerged, indicator species include coon's tail (Ceratophyllum demersum) and duckweeds (Azolla sp., Lemna sp., and Wolffia sp.). When the conditions are drier, or more near the periphery, indicator species are swamp smartweed (Polygonum hydropiperoides), marsh seedbox (Ludwigia palustris), and various sedges (Carex sp. and Cyperus sp.).

Ecological Site Concept
The Well Drained Bottomland ecological site has well drained soils in bottomlands found adjacent to waterways. The sandy and loamy soils drain water quickly from the site, but their proximity to flood-prone waterways creates a unique mixture of plant species. The plants are adapted to withstand flooding and dryness because of the rapid permeability.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, moderately well drained and well drained soils formed from sandy sediments and loamy alluvium. Hatliff and Voss are the representative series and are classified as a coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Fluventic Dystrudept and a mixed, thermic, Oxyaquic Udipsamment, respectively. As with soils that are entisols and inceptisols, extensive horizon development has not occurred. The horizons are generally separated by a change in color as their textures are similar throughout the entire profile. The subsurface is saturated for at least 20 consecutive days, or 30 cumulative days throughout the year.

The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine and American beech. Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and water oak (Quercus nigra) are common and an occasional swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii) will be mixed in. Shrub species can vary, but American hornbeam is prolific, with eastern baccharis (Baccharis halimifolia) and witchhazel (Hamamelis virginiana) mixed in. Since the overstory canopy is somewhat closed, grass and forb species can be sparse. Thick stands of switchcane and broadleaf uniola will be present nearest the waterway where more sunlight exists. These species also stabilize the soil with their roots.

This unique position between the drier uplands and wetter bottomlands creates their plant community.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, well drained to poorly drained soils formed from alluvium. The representative soils are Acadia, Belrose, Kenefick, Spurger, and Votaw. They are widely varying taxonomically, from entisols to alfisols to ultisols. Their unifying factor is their terrace position. They are on lower landscape positions than uplands and on higher landscape positions than bottomlands.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine with intermingled white oak (Quercus alba). Other species commonly found mixed in the overstory are longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and water oak (Quercus nigra). The midstory shrub and tree species can be thick or sparse, depending on time since last fire. American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria) can be extremely dense as the length since last fire increases. Flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) is a conspicuous indicator species, especially late March through early May when blooming. The herbaceous understory is dense and filled with little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), needleleaf rosettegrass (Dichanthelium aciculare), and western brackenfern (Pteridium aquilinum). Summer grapes (Vitis aestivalis) are also very common throughout the site.

Ecological Site Concept
The Well Drained Bottomland ecological site has well drained soils in bottomlands found adjacent to waterways. The sandy and loamy soils drain water quickly from the site, but their proximity to flood-prone waterways creates a unique mixture of plant species. The plants are adapted to withstand flooding and dryness because of the rapid permeability.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, moderately well drained and well drained soils formed from sandy sediments and loamy alluvium. Hatliff and Voss are the representative series and are classified as a coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Fluventic Dystrudept and a mixed, thermic, Oxyaquic Udipsamment, respectively. As with soils that are entisols and inceptisols, extensive horizon development has not occurred. The horizons are generally separated by a change in color as their textures are similar throughout the entire profile. The subsurface is saturated for at least 20 consecutive days, or 30 cumulative days throughout the year.

The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine and American beech. Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and water oak (Quercus nigra) are common and an occasional swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii) will be mixed in. Shrub species can vary, but American hornbeam is prolific, with eastern baccharis (Baccharis halimifolia) and witchhazel (Hamamelis virginiana) mixed in. Since the overstory canopy is somewhat closed, grass and forb species can be sparse. Thick stands of switchcane and broadleaf uniola will be present nearest the waterway where more sunlight exists. These species also stabilize the soil with their roots.

Ecological Site Concept
The Poorly Drained Loamy Bottomland ecological site has very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are frequently flooded. The site is typically flooded for brief to long periods during normal rainfall years. They will stay flooded starting in November and ending in May. The loamy-textured soils combined with the flooding frequency form the plant community.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvial deposits of the Holocene age. Kian, Pluck, and Sourlake are the representative soil series. All three have slightly different taxonomic classifications, but all are within the endoaquept great group. The soils belong to the inceptisol soil order, meaning they have weak horizon development and are generally separated by changes in color. This is due to the addition and removal of soil as the site floods. Also due to flooding, prolonged intervals without access to air cause the soil to have a gleyed, or grey, color. The gleyed horizon can be found within 6 to 27 inches.

The overstory canopy is co-dominated by willow oak (Quercus phellos) and water oak (Quercus nigra). Other species commonly found mixed in are sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and bald cypress (Taxodium distichum). Buttressed trunk bases are found on most of the overstory trees. Possumhaw (Ilex decidua) is the most common shrub found, while red maple (Acer rubrum) and hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana) are shrub-like trees found onsite. The herbaceous understory can be lush or nearly vacant depending on flood length and canopy cover. Sedges (Carex sp.), flatsedges (Cyperus sp.), and rushes (Juncus sp.) dominate the understory.

Ecological Site Concept
The Seasonally Wet Loamy Upland ecological site has very deep loamy, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils influenced by seasonal wetness. The sites do not flood or pond, but instead have a fluctuating water table. From winter into late spring, the soils will be saturated to a depth as high as 12 inches below the surface. The deep loamy soils and the seasonally high water table combine to form the plant community.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative soils series are Aldine, Batson, Kirbyville, Plumgrove, Splendora, and Texla. The soils range in taxonomic classification, from Glossudalfs to Paleudalfs to Paleudults, but all are in the same subgroup of Oxyaquic. Oxyaquic refers to soils that are saturated but not reduced, nor having redoximorphic features.

Reference Community
The overstory is dominated by pine species, comprised of longleaf pine and loblolly pine, with little else. Black hickory (Carya tomentosa) and white oak (Quercus alba) may be present, but not in large amounts. Midstory shrub species are sparse, but American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), and wax myrtle (Morella cerifera) may be present. The herbaceous understory is dense and diverse. Little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are dominant, while big bluestem (Andropogon geradii), beaked panicgrass (Panicum anceps), and other panicgrasses (Panicum sp.) are common.

Ecological Site Concept
The Poorly Drained Loamy Upland ecological site has very deep, poorly drained soils. The poor drainage pattern causes water to persist for long periods of time after precipitation events. The resulting hydrophytic plant communities are able to withstand the presence of water.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly to very poorly drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative series are Bissonnet, Caddo, Camptown, Evadale, Jasco, Kinder, Olive, Sorter, Tyden, and Waller. Since so many soils belong to this ecological site, their taxonomies vary, but all belong to the orders of alfisols and ultisols. The soils extend throughout the whole region and are widely prolific.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine, with longleaf pine as a co-dominant. Other species such as sweetgum (Liquidambar straciflua), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica) may be present, but not in large numbers. The midstory and understory vary significantly, especially with time since last fire. An herbaceous understory will be found directly after a burn and more shrub species will be present as the time since fire lengthens. Common midstory shrubs and trees include wax myrtle (Morella cerifera), dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and redbay (Persea borbonia). Understory species include a variety of sedges (Carex sp.), flatsedges (Cyperus sp.), rushes (Juncus sp.), spikerushes (Eleocharis sp.), and fimbry (Fimbristylis sp.). The presence of spikerushes is oftentimes an indicator of the site. Lizards tail (Saururus cernuus) is the most prolific forb species.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing.

Ecological Site Concept
The Terrace ecological site has very deep soils on terrace landforms. These sites are located on a higher landform than bottomlands and are not as wet. The sites are situated on a lower landform than the uplands and are not as dry. The sites do not flood or pond, but instead have a water table from December to April. This unique position between the drier uplands and wetter bottomlands creates their plant community.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, well drained to poorly drained soils formed from alluvium. The representative soils are Acadia, Belrose, Kenefick, Spurger, and Votaw. They are widely varying taxonomically, from entisols to alfisols to ultisols. Their unifying factor is their terrace position. They are on lower landscape positions than uplands and on higher landscape positions than bottomlands.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine with intermingled white oak (Quercus alba). Other species commonly found mixed in the overstory are longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and water oak (Quercus nigra). The midstory shrub and tree species can be thick or sparse, depending on time since last fire. American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria) can be extremely dense as the length since last fire increases. Flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) is a conspicuous indicator species, especially late March through early May when blooming. The herbaceous understory is dense and filled with little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), needleleaf rosettegrass (Dichanthelium aciculare), and western brackenfern (Pteridium aquilinum). Summer grapes (Vitis aestivalis) are also very common throughout the site.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sloping Clayey Upland ecological site has very deep, moderately well drained soils influenced by slope and clay content. The majority of the region has little to no slope, so the sloping nature of the sites (3 to 5 percent) make them different. Along with slope, the shrink-swell nature of the soils and a less acidic pH (6.6 to 8.8) than surrounding sites give rise to the unique plant community.

Soil Features
The soils of this site consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in clayey alluvium. The soils typically have clay-textured horizons through the entire profile. Soils within this ecological site include Dylan, which is a very-fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Chromic Hapludert. In the lower, subsurface profiles, the clays have shrink-swell properties. The soil shrinks and swells depending on moisture content.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and southern red oak, although other overstory trees are common. Mockernut hickory (Carya tomentosa) is oftentimes found. Hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), and eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) are mainly found in the understory as young trees but may reach into the overstory if fire intervals are lengthy. The understory shrub and herbaceous species can be dense or sparse depending on time since last fire and overstory canopy cover. American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria) are especially prolific, while Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus) and snow-on-the mountain (Euphorbia marginata) serve as herbaceous indicators of the Sloping Clayey Uplands.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Flat ecological site has very deep, poorly drained soils influenced by the shrink-swell properties of the clay content. The soils of this site are vertisols, meaning the soils move with moisture content. Their flat landform and shrink-swell clay properties couple to form their plant community.

Soil Features
The soils of this site consist of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in clayey fluviomarine deposits. The soils typically have clay-textured horizons through the entire profile. Soils within this ecological site include Bevil, Vamont, and Vidrine, which are Chromic Dystraquerts, Oxyaquic Dystruderts, and Aquic Glossudalfs, respectively. Bevil and Vamont belong to the vertisol order because of their vertic properties. This refers to the lower, subsurface profiles, having shrink-swell properties. The soil shrinks and swells depending on moisture content and leaves large cracks on the surface when dry. The clay material in Vidrine is not quite as active, but is included in the Clayey Flats because of the similar landform position and horizon profile.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy consists of several hardwoods species. Swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michaeux) is frequently dominant and willow oak (Quercus phellos) is highly prevalent. Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), water oak (Quercus nigra), and cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda) are often found associated on the site. Dense cover of dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor) is an indicator of the Clayey Flats. Other species found in midstory are arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua). The herbaceous understory varies depending on overstory and midstory densities. Longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum) and broadleaf uniola (Chasmanthium latifolium) are especially common because of their high tolerance to shady conditions.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

The loamy-textured soils combined with the flooding frequency form the plant community.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvial deposits of the Holocene age. Kian, Pluck, and Sourlake are the representative soil series. All three have slightly different taxonomic classifications, but all are within the endoaquept great group. The soils belong to the inceptisol soil order, meaning they have weak horizon development and are generally separated by changes in color. This is due to the addition and removal of soil as the site floods. Also due to flooding, prolonged intervals without access to air cause the soil to have a gleyed, or grey, color. The gleyed horizon can be found within 6 to 27 inches.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is co-dominated by willow oak (Quercus phellos) and water oak (Quercus nigra). Other species commonly found mixed in are sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and bald cypress (Taxodium distichum). Buttressed trunk bases are found on most of the overstory trees. Possumhaw (Ilex decidua) is the most common shrub found, while red maple (Acer rubrum) and hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana) are shrub-like trees found onsite. The herbaceous understory can be lush or nearly vacant depending on flood length and canopy cover. Sedges (Carex sp.), flatsedges (Cyperus sp.), and rushes (Juncus sp.) dominate the understory.

Ecological Site Concept
The Swamp ecological site has very deep, very poorly drained soils greater than 80 inches (203 centimeters) that are ponded throughout a portion of the year. A wetland plant community exists because it is the lowest position on the landscape, along with the flooding and ponding regimes.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by gleyed horizons throughout the entire soil profile, measured to 80 inches (203 centimeters). The gleying, or grey soil color, is a result of anaerobic conditions from the soils being saturated for long periods. The soils show little soil development indicative of the entisols soil order. The surface layer is darkest and the underlying subsoil layers are mostly distinguished by color and exhibit more hydric soil features besides gleying. Iron-manganese masses, oxidized root channels, and other indicators of anoxic conditions are evident. The Cowmarsh series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvial deposits of the Holocene age. The series is classified as a fine, smectitic, acid, thermic Typic Fluvaqeunt. Other soils are included within the ecological site have the same influencing water features and support hydrophytic vegetation.

The vegetation that has adapted to the anaerobic conditions are dominant. The United State Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) classifies plants that occur in wetlands with an estimated probability greater than 99 percent obligate (OBL), and those 67 to 99 percent facultative wetland (FACW) plants. Obligate and facultative wetland plants are the most common encountered throughout the Swamps. When submerged, indicator species include coon's tail (Ceratophyllum demersum) and duckweeds (Azolla sp., Lemna sp., and Wolffia sp.). When the conditions are drier, or more near the periphery, indicator species are swamp smartweed (Polygonum hydropiperoides), marsh seedbox (Ludwigia palustris), and various sedges (Carex sp. and Cyperus sp.).

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Flat ecological site has very deep, poorly drained soils influenced by the shrink-swell properties of the clay content. The soils of this site are vertisols, meaning the soils move with moisture content. Their flat landform and shrink-swell clay properties couple to form their plant community.

Soil Features
The soils of this site consist of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in clayey fluviomarine deposits. The soils typically have clay-textured horizons through the entire profile. Soils within this ecological site include Bevil, Vamont, and Vidrine, which are Chromic Dystraquerts, Oxyaquic Dystruderts, and Aquic Glossudalfs, respectively. Bevil and Vamont belong to the vertisol order because of their vertic properties. This refers to the lower, subsurface profiles, having shrink-swell properties. The soil shrinks and swells depending on moisture content and leaves large cracks on the surface when dry. The clay material in Vidrine is not quite as active, but is included in the Clayey Flats because of the similar landform position and horizon profile.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy consists of several hardwoods species. Swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michaeux) is frequently dominant and willow oak (Quercus phellos) is highly prevalent. Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), water oak (Quercus nigra), and cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda) are often found associated on the site. Dense cover of dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor) is an indicator of the Clayey Flats. Other species found in midstory are arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua). The herbaceous understory varies depending on overstory and midstory densities. Longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum) and broadleaf uniola (Chasmanthium latifolium) are especially common because of their high tolerance to shady conditions.

Ecological Site Concept
The Poorly Drained Loamy Upland ecological site has very deep, poorly drained soils. The poor drainage pattern causes water to persist for long periods of time after precipitation events. The resulting hydrophytic plant communities are able to withstand the presence of water.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly to very poorly drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative series are Bissonnet, Caddo, Camptown, Evadale, Jasco, Kinder, Olive, Sorter, Tyden, and Waller. Since so many soils belong to this ecological site, their taxonomies vary, but all belong to the orders of alfisols and ultisols. The soils extend throughout the whole region and are widely prolific.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine, with longleaf pine as a co-dominant. Other species such as sweetgum (Liquidambar straciflua), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica) may be present, but not in large numbers. The midstory and understory vary significantly, especially with time since last fire. An herbaceous understory will be found directly after a burn and more shrub species will be present as the time since fire lengthens. Common midstory shrubs and trees include wax myrtle (Morella cerifera), dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and redbay (Persea borbonia). Understory species include a variety of sedges (Carex sp.), flatsedges (Cyperus sp.), rushes (Juncus sp.), spikerushes (Eleocharis sp.), and fimbry (Fimbristylis sp.). The presence of spikerushes is oftentimes an indicator of the site. Lizards tail (Saururus cernuus) is the most prolific forb species.

Ecological Site Concept
The Poorly Drained Loamy Upland ecological site has very deep, poorly drained soils. The poor drainage pattern causes water to persist for long periods of time after precipitation events. The resulting hydrophytic plant communities are able to withstand the presence of water.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly to very poorly drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative series are Bissonnet, Caddo, Camptown, Evadale, Jasco, Kinder, Olive, Sorter, Tyden, and Waller. Since so many soils belong to this ecological site, their taxonomies vary, but all belong to the orders of alfisols and ultisols. The soils extend throughout the whole region and are widely prolific.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine, with longleaf pine as a co-dominant. Other species such as sweetgum (Liquidambar straciflua), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica) may be present, but not in large numbers. The midstory and understory vary significantly, especially with time since last fire. An herbaceous understory will be found directly after a burn and more shrub species will be present as the time since fire lengthens. Common midstory shrubs and trees include wax myrtle (Morella cerifera), dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and redbay (Persea borbonia). Understory species include a variety of sedges (Carex sp.), flatsedges (Cyperus sp.), rushes (Juncus sp.), spikerushes (Eleocharis sp.), and fimbry (Fimbristylis sp.). The presence of spikerushes is oftentimes an indicator of the site. Lizards tail (Saururus cernuus) is the most prolific forb species.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile. Runoff is low and erosion is negligible. Soils correlated to this site include: Addicks, Algoa, Anahuac, Chesterville, Cyfair, Hockley, Katy, Kemah, Labelle, Levac, Meaton, Mocarey, Mockley, Morey, Orcadia, Spindletop, Viterbo, Winnie, Wockley, and Yeaton.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
 The central concept of this site is somewhat isolated from salt water intrusion. The salinity ranges are never high but there is some salinity in the soil that will manifest itself during periods of dry weather. The best indicator plant on this site is seashore Paspalum. Lesser amounts of California bulrush, Olney bulrush, softstem bulrush, marshhay cordgrass, spikesedges, seedbox, Colorado River hemp, and cattails are also found. Elevation, drainage, salinity, water depth, and duration play a major role in the vegetation. Small areas of open water are also included. These areas are important to waterfowl and other wildlife because habitat diversity. Water salinity level varies throughout the year. Fresher water is indicated by the presence of narrowleaf cattail, seedbox, whorled pennywort, and softstem bulrush.

Soil Features
The soil series in this site concept are Barnett, Harris, Ijam & Leerco. They are very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable firm mineral soils that formed in mineral sediments of Coastal Marshes. Surface runoff and internal drainage are lacking.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile. Runoff is low and erosion is negligible. Soils correlated to this site include: Addicks, Algoa, Anahuac, Chesterville, Cyfair, Hockley, Katy, Kemah, Labelle, Levac, Meaton, Mocarey, Mockley, Morey, Orcadia, Spindletop, Viterbo, Winnie, Wockley, and Yeaton.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
The sites are sandy, salty, and occasionally flood. This creates a vegetative community adapted to nutrient-poor, saline, and wet conditions.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, somewhat poorly or poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. Soil reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline. Salinity and sodicity levels increase with depth. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon, natric horizon, and aquic conditions. Soils correlated to this site include: Greta and Woodsboro.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire maintained, open grassland with gulf cordgrass and little bluestem accompanied by lesser amounts of switchgrass, Hartweg's paspalum, seashore saltgrass, marshhay cordgrass and traces of bushy sea oxeye. Warm-season grasses are prolific throughout. Forbs and woody species make up a minor component of this community. Variations in salinity and soil moisture cause local variations in the plant community. In low-lying, highly saline areas, gulf cordgrass may occur in pure stands. Areas with less salinity in the soil will have higher plant diversity. Cordgrasses reproduce vegetatively by rhizomes and are resilient to disturbance. However, once gulf cordgrass is eliminated, it is hard to reestablish. Reseeding is not an option for this site because most of the native species found on this site produce sterile seeds. To reestablish these species transplanting is possible for reestablishment. Heavy grazing pressure will quickly suppress little bluestem leading to a dominance of Gulf cordgrass. Gulf cordgrass becomes highly palatable to livestock when burned; however, it is unpalatable when not burned frequently. Not only does fire help to control woody plant species within this plant community, but it also helps to maintain a significant component of little bluestem when properly grazed.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile. Runoff is low and erosion is negligible. Soils correlated to this site include: Addicks, Algoa, Anahuac, Chesterville, Cyfair, Hockley, Katy, Kemah, Labelle, Levac, Meaton, Mocarey, Mockley, Morey, Orcadia, Spindletop, Viterbo, Winnie, Wockley, and Yeaton.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
The Seasonally Wet Loamy Upland ecological site has very deep loamy, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils influenced by seasonal wetness. The sites do not flood or pond, but instead have a fluctuating water table. From winter into late spring, the soils will be saturated to a depth as high as 12 inches below the surface. The deep loamy soils and the seasonally high water table combine to form the plant community.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative soils series are Aldine, Batson, Kirbyville, Plumgrove, Splendora, and Texla. The soils range in taxonomic classification, from Glossudalfs to Paleudalfs to Paleudults, but all are in the same subgroup of Oxyaquic. Oxyaquic refers to soils that are saturated but not reduced, nor having redoximorphic features.

Reference Community
The overstory is dominated by pine species, comprised of longleaf pine and loblolly pine, with little else. Black hickory (Carya tomentosa) and white oak (Quercus alba) may be present, but not in large amounts. Midstory shrub species are sparse, but American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), and wax myrtle (Morella cerifera) may be present. The herbaceous understory is dense and diverse. Little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are dominant, while big bluestem (Andropogon geradii), beaked panicgrass (Panicum anceps), and other panicgrasses (Panicum sp.) are common.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile. Runoff is low and erosion is negligible. Soils correlated to this site include: Addicks, Algoa, Anahuac, Chesterville, Cyfair, Hockley, Katy, Kemah, Labelle, Levac, Meaton, Mocarey, Mockley, Morey, Orcadia, Spindletop, Viterbo, Winnie, Wockley, and Yeaton.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile. Runoff is low and erosion is negligible. Soils correlated to this site include: Addicks, Algoa, Anahuac, Chesterville, Cyfair, Hockley, Katy, Kemah, Labelle, Levac, Meaton, Mocarey, Mockley, Morey, Orcadia, Spindletop, Viterbo, Winnie, Wockley, and Yeaton.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
The Well Drained Bottomland ecological site has well drained soils in bottomlands found adjacent to waterways. The sandy and loamy soils drain water quickly from the site, but their proximity to flood-prone waterways creates a unique mixture of plant species. The plants are adapted to withstand flooding and dryness because of the rapid permeability.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, moderately well drained and well drained soils formed from sandy sediments and loamy alluvium. Hatliff and Voss are the representative series and are classified as a coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Fluventic Dystrudept and a mixed, thermic, Oxyaquic Udipsamment, respectively. As with soils that are entisols and inceptisols, extensive horizon development has not occurred. The horizons are generally separated by a change in color as their textures are similar throughout the entire profile. The subsurface is saturated for at least 20 consecutive days, or 30 cumulative days throughout the year.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine and American beech. Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and water oak (Quercus nigra) are common and an occasional swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii) will be mixed in. Shrub species can vary, but American hornbeam is prolific, with eastern baccharis (Baccharis halimifolia) and witchhazel (Hamamelis virginiana) mixed in. Since the overstory canopy is somewhat closed, grass and forb species can be sparse. Thick stands of switchcane and broadleaf uniola will be present nearest the waterway where more sunlight exists. These species also stabilize the soil with their roots.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile. Runoff is low and erosion is negligible. Soils correlated to this site include: Addicks, Algoa, Anahuac, Chesterville, Cyfair, Hockley, Katy, Kemah, Labelle, Levac, Meaton, Mocarey, Mockley, Morey, Orcadia, Spindletop, Viterbo, Winnie, Wockley, and Yeaton.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

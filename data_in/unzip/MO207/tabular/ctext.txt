This soil is occasionally flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 12 inches during January, February, March, April, May, November, December. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 2w.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria.  There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. "|"23136486"|"23662500"

Ecological Site Concept
The Loess Terrace is a diverse grassland prairie. A fragipan layer exists two to three feet below that surface that restricts root growth and perches water. Vegetative species are adapted to the restrictive layer.

Soil Features
The ecological site consists of very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in thick loess. These soils have a fragipan between 28 and 37 inches deep that restrict root growth and perch water during winter and early in spring. Soils correlated to this site include: Calloway, Grenada, and Henry.

Reference Community
The vegetation adapted to the Loess Prairie is a diverse grassland. Grasses occupying the area include: little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), muhly (Muhlenbergia sp.) dropseeds (Sporobolus sp.), and sedges (Carex sp.). Forbs include: blackeyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta), prairie tea (Croton monanthogynus), blazing star (Liatris sp.), and golden tickseed (Coreopsis tinctoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons. Besides the Bowie series, the Alto, Beauregard, Blevins, Diboll, Elrose, Eylau, Fuller, Gunter, Keatchie, Keithville, Kullit, Latex, Oakwood, Olla, Penning, Rigolette, Rogan, Ruston, Saffell, Sailes, Sawlit, Sawtown, Sawyer, Scottsville, Smithdale, Ulto, and Warnock are correlated to the Loamy Uplands.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The ecological site is associated with deep, well-drained, moderately rapidly-permeable soils on uplands. Surface soils range from loamy sands, sandy loams, or loams. The clay increase is gradual throughout the soil profile. The profile typically transitions from a sandy/loamy surface to a sandy loam or sandy clay loam subsurface. Soils correlated to this site include: Boykin, Choates, Depcor, Doucette, Hillister, Kurth, Laska, Letney, Lovelady, Malbis, Pinetucky, and Stringtown. 

Reference Community
Longleaf pine trees comprise the majority of the overstory. The occurrence in the overstory on any given site is between 75 to 100 percent. Blackjack and post oaks have established on some sites, each ranging from 0 to 10 percent of the overall canopy structure. Shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) will be found in lesser amounts, usually less than 5 percent. Farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), sassafras (Sassafras albidium), and oak saplings are common in the mid-story layer (4.5 to 13 feet), although overall presence in the system is quite low (0 to 10 percent). Both communities are characterized by a diverse ground layer with minor patches of bare ground and litter (5 to 15 percent and 10 to 30 percent, respectively). Little bluestem and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are the most abundant grasses seen in the two communities. Indicator forbs include, Virginia tephrosia (Tephrosia virginiana), St. Andrew's cross (Hypericum hypericoides), healing croton (Croton argyranthemus), and flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata).

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface.

Reference Community
Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons. Besides the Bowie series, the Alto, Beauregard, Blevins, Diboll, Elrose, Eylau, Fuller, Gunter, Keatchie, Keithville, Kullit, Latex, Oakwood, Olla, Penning, Rigolette, Rogan, Ruston, Saffell, Sailes, Sawlit, Sawtown, Sawyer, Scottsville, Smithdale, Ulto, and Warnock are correlated to the Loamy Uplands.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles. The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam occurring between 20 and 40 inches continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Briley series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain sediments. The series is classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by their upper horizons of sands and presence of an argillic between 20 and 40 inches. Besides the Briley series, Darbonne, Larue, Lilbert, Rentzel, Rosalie, Tenaha, Trep, and Wolfpen are correlated to the ecological site.

Reference Community
Shortleaf pine trees comprise the majority of the overstory. The occurrence in the overstory on any given site is between 75 to 100 percent. Blackjack and post oaks have established on some sites, comprising up to 20 percent of the overall canopy structure. Farkleberry, winged sumac (Rhus copallinum), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), sassafras (Sassafras albidium), and oak saplings are common in the mid-story layer, increasing in abundance with time since last fire. Both communities are characterized by a diverse ground layer with sometimes large accumulations of plant litter, 15 to 45 percent. Little bluestem and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are the most abundant grasses seen in the two communities, at times seemingly dominating the entire area. Indicator forbs include Virginia tephrosia (Tephrosia virginiana), St. Andrew's cross (Hypericum hypericoides), Nuttall's wild indigo (Baptistia nuttalliana), and Atlanta pigeonwings (Clitoria mariana).

Ecological Site Concept
The ecological site has very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are frequently flooded. The site is typically flooded for brief to long periods during normal rainfall years. They will stay flooded starting in November and ending in May. The loamy-textured soils combined with the flooding frequency form the plant community. 

Soil Features
Mattex and Manco are two of the representative soils of the Loamy Bottomlands. This ecological site formed from loamy alluvium and is associated with very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable loamy entisols on bottomlands. The first gleyed-subsurface horizon usually appears within 8 to 11 inches. The gleying and other redoximorphic features continue through the profile usually past 80 inches. Gleying and redoximorphic features are caused by prolonged inundation. The sites are very flat with slopes from 0 to 1 percent. Other soils correlated to this site include: Amy, Angelina, Bibb, Bleakwood, Dreka, Groom, Guyton, Kanebreak, Mathiston, Mattex, Nahatche, Pophers, Sardis, Marietta, Mooreville, Ochlockonee, and Socagee.

Reference Community
The Loamy Bottomland system communities are based highly on micro-relief throughout the landscape. A subtle rise or fall of mere inches can drastically alter the vegetative composition. The willow oak community (1.1) represents the middle-relief elevation in comparison to communities 1.2 and 1.3. Plant species occurring in the willow oak community are usually facultative wet according to the U.S. Army Corps' Wetland Delineation Manual (2010). Understory indicators include blunt broom sedge (Carex tribuloides), smallspike false nettle (Boehmeria cylindrical), and American Buckwheat vine (Brunnichia ovata).

They will stay flooded starting in November and ending in May. The loamy-textured soils combined with the flooding frequency form the plant community. 

Soil Features
Mattex and Manco are two of the representative soils of the Loamy Bottomlands. This ecological site formed from loamy alluvium and is associated with very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable loamy entisols on bottomlands. The first gleyed-subsurface horizon usually appears within 8 to 11 inches. The gleying and other redoximorphic features continue through the profile usually past 80 inches. Gleying and redoximorphic features are caused by prolonged inundation. The sites are very flat with slopes from 0 to 1 percent. Other soils correlated to this site include: Amy, Angelina, Bibb, Bleakwood, Dreka, Groom, Guyton, Kanebreak, Mathiston, Mattex, Nahatche, Pophers, Sardis, Marietta, Mooreville, Ochlockonee, and Socagee.

Reference Community
The Loamy Bottomland system communities are based highly on micro-relief throughout the landscape. A subtle rise or fall of mere inches can drastically alter the vegetative composition. The willow oak community (1.1) represents the middle-relief elevation in comparison to communities 1.2 and 1.3. Plant species occurring in the willow oak community are usually facultative wet according to the U.S. Army Corps' Wetland Delineation Manual (2010). Understory indicators include blunt broom sedge (Carex tribuloides), smallspike false nettle (Boehmeria cylindrical), and American Buckwheat vine (Brunnichia ovata).

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons. Besides the Bowie series, the Alto, Beauregard, Blevins, Diboll, Elrose, Eylau, Fuller, Gunter, Keatchie, Keithville, Kullit, Latex, Oakwood, Olla, Penning, Rigolette, Rogan, Ruston, Saffell, Sailes, Sawlit, Sawtown, Sawyer, Scottsville, Smithdale, Ulto, and Warnock are correlated to the Loamy Uplands.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Seasonally Wet Upland site is unique by its upland position on the landscape, while also having a seasonally high water table. Clay soils in the subhorizons cause water to stay in the profile for long periods of time, especially from November to May. Not only does the water table affect the plants, but many of the soils are shallow with their depth to bedrock as low as 16 inches.

Soil Features
The soils consist of shallow to very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils formed from mudstone residuum. The representative soils are: Alusa, Anacoco, Browndell, Colita, Corrigan, Elmina, Felker, Fetzer, Gomery, Kolin, Libuse, Lummus, Metcalf, Tiak, and Wiergate. They are widely varying taxonomically, from alfisols to ultisols to vertisols. Their unifying factor is their upland position with a fluctuating water table. Many of the soils have restrictions to bedrock, classifying them as shallow.

Reference Community
The varying degree of water availability and root restriction cause the understory sites to be highly variable. Common understory species include: longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), sedges (Carex sp.), partridgeberry (Mitchella repens), and Texas ironweed (Vernonia texana). Common shrub species include: American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshallii), and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Floodplain is a rapidly-changing ecological site adjacent to streams and rivers. The sandy point bars and splays are influenced by flooding and the meandering water currents. Vegetative species change as flooding adds and removes sediments.

Soil Features
Crevasse is the only soil correlated to the ecological site. The Crevasse series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy alluvium. The taxonomic classification is mixed, thermic Typic Udipsamment. Very little horizon development exists and all are sandy throughout the entire profile.

Reference Community
The Willow/Cottonwood Forest Community represents primary succession and the earliest vegetative colonization of newly-formed point bars and splays. Black willow (Salix nigra) is the immediate colonizer, while cottonwood (Populus deltoides) is a secondary associate. The willows will eventually give way as cottonwoods age and secondary colonizers arrive.

Ecological Site Concept
The ecological site has very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are frequently flooded. The site is typically flooded for brief to long periods during normal rainfall years. They will stay flooded starting in November and ending in May. The loamy-textured soils combined with the flooding frequency form the plant community. 

Soil Features
Mattex and Manco are two of the representative soils of the Loamy Bottomlands. This ecological site formed from loamy alluvium and is associated with very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable loamy entisols on bottomlands. The first gleyed-subsurface horizon usually appears within 8 to 11 inches. The gleying and other redoximorphic features continue through the profile usually past 80 inches. Gleying and redoximorphic features are caused by prolonged inundation. The sites are very flat with slopes from 0 to 1 percent. Other soils correlated to this site include: Amy, Angelina, Bibb, Bleakwood, Dreka, Groom, Guyton, Kanebreak, Mathiston, Mattex, Nahatche, Pophers, Sardis, Marietta, Mooreville, Ochlockonee, and Socagee.

Reference Community
The Loamy Bottomland system communities are based highly on micro-relief throughout the landscape. A subtle rise or fall of mere inches can drastically alter the vegetative composition. The willow oak community (1.1) represents the middle-relief elevation in comparison to communities 1.2 and 1.3. Plant species occurring in the willow oak community are usually facultative wet according to the U.S. Army Corps' Wetland Delineation Manual (2010). Understory indicators include blunt broom sedge (Carex tribuloides), smallspike false nettle (Boehmeria cylindrical), and American Buckwheat vine (Brunnichia ovata).

Ecological Site Concept
The Terrace ecological site has very deep soils on terrace landforms. These sites are located on a higher landform than bottomlands and are not as wet. The sites are situated on a lower landform than the uplands and are not as dry. The sites do not flood or pond. This unique position between the drier uplands and wetter bottomlands creates their plant community.

Soil Features
Alazan, Attoyac, and Bernaldo are representative soils of the Terraces. The Terraces can have a wide range of textures and depths. The grouping factor is, all are located on the terrace landform position. Besides the previously listed soils, these are correlated as well: Addielou, Annona, Austonio, Bearhead, Besner, Bistineau, Cadeville, Cart, Chireno, Eastham, Elysian, Erno, Forbing, Freestone, Gallime, Garner, Glenmora, Hallsbluff, Keiffer, Landman, Latch, Mckamie, Moten, Multey, Raino, Shatta, Spurger, Timpson, Vesey, Waskom, and Woden.

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons. Besides the Bowie series, the Alto, Beauregard, Blevins, Diboll, Elrose, Eylau, Fuller, Gunter, Keatchie, Keithville, Kullit, Latex, Oakwood, Olla, Penning, Rigolette, Rogan, Ruston, Saffell, Sailes, Sawlit, Sawtown, Sawyer, Scottsville, Smithdale, Ulto, and Warnock are correlated to the Loamy Uplands.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons. Besides the Bowie series, the Alto, Beauregard, Blevins, Diboll, Elrose, Eylau, Fuller, Gunter, Keatchie, Keithville, Kullit, Latex, Oakwood, Olla, Penning, Rigolette, Rogan, Ruston, Saffell, Sailes, Sawlit, Sawtown, Sawyer, Scottsville, Smithdale, Ulto, and Warnock are correlated to the Loamy Uplands.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons. Besides the Bowie series, the Alto, Beauregard, Blevins, Diboll, Elrose, Eylau, Fuller, Gunter, Keatchie, Keithville, Kullit, Latex, Oakwood, Olla, Penning, Rigolette, Rogan, Ruston, Saffell, Sailes, Sawlit, Sawtown, Sawyer, Scottsville, Smithdale, Ulto, and Warnock are correlated to the Loamy Uplands.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The ecological site has very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are frequently flooded. The site is typically flooded for brief to long periods during normal rainfall years. They will stay flooded starting in November and ending in May. The loamy-textured soils combined with the flooding frequency form the plant community. 

Soil Features
Mattex and Manco are two of the representative soils of the Loamy Bottomlands. This ecological site formed from loamy alluvium and is associated with very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable loamy entisols on bottomlands. The first gleyed-subsurface horizon usually appears within 8 to 11 inches. The gleying and other redoximorphic features continue through the profile usually past 80 inches. Gleying and redoximorphic features are caused by prolonged inundation. The sites are very flat with slopes from 0 to 1 percent. Other soils correlated to this site include: Amy, Angelina, Bibb, Bleakwood, Dreka, Groom, Guyton, Kanebreak, Mathiston, Mattex, Nahatche, Pophers, Sardis, Marietta, Mooreville, Ochlockonee, and Socagee.

Reference Community
The Loamy Bottomland system communities are based highly on micro-relief throughout the landscape. A subtle rise or fall of mere inches can drastically alter the vegetative composition. The willow oak community (1.1) represents the middle-relief elevation in comparison to communities 1.2 and 1.3. Plant species occurring in the willow oak community are usually facultative wet according to the U.S. Army Corps' Wetland Delineation Manual (2010). Understory indicators include blunt broom sedge (Carex tribuloides), smallspike false nettle (Boehmeria cylindrical), and American Buckwheat vine (Brunnichia ovata).

Ecological Site Concept
The ecological site has very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are frequently flooded. The site is typically flooded for brief to long periods during normal rainfall years. They will stay flooded starting in November and ending in May. The loamy-textured soils combined with the flooding frequency form the plant community. 

Soil Features
Mattex and Manco are two of the representative soils of the Loamy Bottomlands. This ecological site formed from loamy alluvium and is associated with very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable loamy entisols on bottomlands. The first gleyed-subsurface horizon usually appears within 8 to 11 inches. The gleying and other redoximorphic features continue through the profile usually past 80 inches. Gleying and redoximorphic features are caused by prolonged inundation. The sites are very flat with slopes from 0 to 1 percent. Other soils correlated to this site include: Amy, Angelina, Bibb, Bleakwood, Dreka, Groom, Guyton, Kanebreak, Mathiston, Mattex, Nahatche, Pophers, Sardis, Marietta, Mooreville, Ochlockonee, and Socagee.

Reference Community
The Loamy Bottomland system communities are based highly on micro-relief throughout the landscape. A subtle rise or fall of mere inches can drastically alter the vegetative composition. The willow oak community (1.1) represents the middle-relief elevation in comparison to communities 1.2 and 1.3. Plant species occurring in the willow oak community are usually facultative wet according to the U.S. Army Corps' Wetland Delineation Manual (2010). Understory indicators include blunt broom sedge (Carex tribuloides), smallspike false nettle (Boehmeria cylindrical), and American Buckwheat vine (Brunnichia ovata).

Ecological Site Concept
The ecological site has very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are frequently flooded. The site is typically flooded for brief to long periods during normal rainfall years. They will stay flooded starting in November and ending in May. The loamy-textured soils combined with the flooding frequency form the plant community. 

Soil Features
Mattex and Manco are two of the representative soils of the Loamy Bottomlands. This ecological site formed from loamy alluvium and is associated with very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable loamy entisols on bottomlands. The first gleyed-subsurface horizon usually appears within 8 to 11 inches. The gleying and other redoximorphic features continue through the profile usually past 80 inches. Gleying and redoximorphic features are caused by prolonged inundation. The sites are very flat with slopes from 0 to 1 percent. Other soils correlated to this site include: Amy, Angelina, Bibb, Bleakwood, Dreka, Groom, Guyton, Kanebreak, Mathiston, Mattex, Nahatche, Pophers, Sardis, Marietta, Mooreville, Ochlockonee, and Socagee.

Reference Community
The Loamy Bottomland system communities are based highly on micro-relief throughout the landscape. A subtle rise or fall of mere inches can drastically alter the vegetative composition. The willow oak community (1.1) represents the middle-relief elevation in comparison to communities 1.2 and 1.3. Plant species occurring in the willow oak community are usually facultative wet according to the U.S. Army Corps' Wetland Delineation Manual (2010). Understory indicators include blunt broom sedge (Carex tribuloides), smallspike false nettle (Boehmeria cylindrical), and American Buckwheat vine (Brunnichia ovata).

Ecological Site Concept
The Wet Terrace site has very deep soils on terrace landforms. They are positioned higher than bottomlands and lower that uplands. This landscape position coupled with their slowly permeable, poorly drained soils form their unique plant community.

Soil Features
The ecological site consist of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in silty and clayey alluvium. Soils correlated to this ecological site include: Bodcau, Dubach, Frizzell, Gurdon, Haggerty, Kildare, Mollicy, Muldrow, Rodessa, Thage, Vick, Weston, Wrightsville, and Zenoria.

Reference Community
Dense shrub layers can be common on the Wet Terraces. Species of flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), green ash, American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), American beautyberry (Callicarpa Americana), winged elm (Ulmus alata), American holly (Ilex opaca), and rusty blackhaw (Viburnum rufidulum). A wide variety of grasses and forbs may be common if the overstory and shrub layer are not restricting light to the understory. Longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), hairy bedstraw (Galium pilosum), greenbriers (Smilax sp.), various sedges (Carex sp.), and rushes (Juncus sp.)

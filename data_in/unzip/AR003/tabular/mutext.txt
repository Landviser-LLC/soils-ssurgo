Summary of Published Manuscript Map Unit Descriptions 
(Summarize findings from map unit description in surveys. Main items that need to be summarized are: composition and minor components, landscape, landform and positions of major and minor components, erosion hazards, and major land use. This is not an all-inclusive list and other items should be added as needed. Input of all items must be kept in a format that will transfer to plain text without a loss of intended organization. Delete this paragraph and use headings listed below)
Composition:
Amy soils are 85 percent of the map unit based on map unit descriptions in the manuscripts and NASIS data population.
Minor Components:
 Leadvale, Pheba, and Aquults, are the minor components listed in the manuscripts and NASIS. Percentages for individual minor components were not listed in the manuscript. Minor components were not named in some surveys.  All of this data will be used to assign estimated percentages to the mlra mapunit components.
Landscape, Landform and Positions for Components:
Amy:       Landform: Stream Terraces
                Landscape: valleys
Aquults:  Landform: Depressions
	  Landscape: Coastal Plains
Leadvale: Landform: Terraces
                  Landscape: Uplands
Pheba:     Landform: interfluves
                 Landscape: Coastal Plains

Major Land Uses:
About 95 percent Woodlands, 4 percent cropland and less than 1 percent Urbanland
Additional items

Describe Differences Between MLRA Map Unit and Map Units Being Harmonized:
Describe the differences between map units and the harmonized unit
Very little inconsistencies exist in the populated horizon data. The main differences are in the MAP, MAAT. The unit is mapped in an area with tight temperature and moisture gradients. 
The runoff, drainage classes, and component soil moisture tables do not match, and therefore neither do the soil interpretations that use these properties and qualities.

Lab Data:
(List pedon IDs, if there is no lab data or lab data is inadequate, identify the need for a future mlra update project)
KSSL  No KSSL Lab Data for Amy Series One pedon sampled in TX297. S95TX297000
University -  University of Arkansas Lab
Local  Fourteen pedons with local lab data exist. 

Pedon Data in NASIS:
(Statement of the amount and distribution of pedon data. Give numbers of pedons and transects, not a list of pedon IDs. If the distribution of pedon data is unrepresentative of the map unit range, say so. For example:)
There are no known transect data associated with this project. There are 15 pedons currently in NASIS of the Amy series.

Other Attribute Issues:
	Costal Plain Soil
	Established in Pulaski County, Arkansas
	Hydric Soil
	Mainly found in Arkansas
	Formed during the Pleistocence Era

Future Project Needs: 
	Gather Transect/Pedon Data of Amy silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes to get an accurate assessment of the mapunit composition.
	Sample Amy to send to Lincoln for KSSL Data
	Develop Monolith of Amy for Display and Educational Purposes

	Evaluate and Ground Truth Amy silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes delineations that cross multiple counties
Evaluation of map unit interpretations (subcategory interpretation)

Interpretation Join Issues:
No major interpretation issues are associated with the harmonizing of Amy silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

Evaluation of the map unit delineations (subcategory spatial)

Join Issues:

Spatial Data Quality: 
(If any are known, just make a statement about which counties have spatial data problems prompted by answering the questions at the bottom.  Such as map units that may be combined with this unit or extent is too large and needs to be refined. Also certain areas may need to be changed to a different series or split into two map units. Example:)
Slope Analysis: 
No spatial analysis was conducted.
Future Project Needs:
Some extensive revision of soil survey delineations is needed and the correction over the map unit extent of any glaring cartographic errors.

The Grenada series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in thick loess. These soils are shallow or moderately deep to a fragipan that perches water during wet seasons in late winter and early in spring. This map unit is supported by 3 pedon descriptions. The 3 pedon descriptions in NASIS are the representative pedons (TUDs) for the correlated map units in their respective counties/parishes. The number of pedons in NASIS are not sufficient for the number of correlated acres; therefore, a future field project is needed to collect additional data and transects.

Field Projects Needed:
	Collect field data-Pedon & Transect descriptions throughout map unit distribution, for documentation, so that range of characteristics are adequate.
	Collect lab sample for analysis
	Collect pedon descriptions for minor component percentages and naming
	Evaluate and update productivity ratings to align with modern day practices
	Evaluate spatial data, and realign polygons to fit where they are supposed to be in the world

Summary of published manuscript Map Unit Descriptions 
Hebert silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes is currently mapped in eleven soil surveys thru out the 9-PNB MLRA region. The Map Unit Descriptions in each of these surveys were all fairly consistent with one another concerning this map unit. Cropland use was the majority land use for this map unit and this map unit was found along natural levee systems thru out this MLRA. There were some degree of variations among the minor components of this map unit. Rilla, Gallion, Perry, and Portland soils were the most common minor components found in the each map unit description. The Land capability class was either a 2w or 2w5 thru out all of the surveys.

Composition: Hebert soils are 88 percent of the map unit based on map unit descriptions in the manuscripts and NASIS data population.
Minor Components:
 Gallion, Perry, Portland, Rilla are the minor components listed in the manuscripts and NASIS. Percentages for individual minor components were not listed in the manuscript..  All of this data will be used to assign estimated percentages to the mlra map unit components.

Summary of Published Manuscript Map Unit Descriptions 

Composition:
 Pheba soils are 85 percent of the map unit based on map unit descriptions in the manuscripts and NASIS data population.
Minor Components:
Amy, Aquults, and Guyton, are the minor components listed in the manuscripts and NASIS. Percentages for individual minor components were not listed in the manuscript. Minor components were not named in some surveys.  All of this data will be used to assign estimated percentages to the mlra mapunit components.
Landscape, Landform and Positions for Components:
Major Land Uses:
About 90 percent  cropland , 10 percent forrested and less than 1 percent Urbanland
Additional items

Describe Differences Between MLRA Map Unit and Map Units Being Harmonized:

Very little data inconsistencies exist . 
Lab Data:
(List pedon IDs, if there is no lab data or lab data is inadequate, identify the need for a future mlra update project)
KSSL  No Lab Data Available for any of the counties in the 9-PNB region, currently all Pheba KSSL data is from Mississippi which not apart of this SDJR project.
Local  Eight pedons with local lab data exist, four of the eight pedon are within the 9-PNB region.

Pedon Data in NASIS:
There are 18 pedons of Pheba in NASIS 5 of the eighteen stems from a RaCA site in Louisana,  12  are TPs from  Mississippi and 1 from Arkansas. One pedon in NASIS is from the 9-PNB region.

Other Attribute Issues:


Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes is mapped in four counites within the 9-PNB region. The Soil Series Pheba is established in Clay Mississippi.  This map unit lies within the Western Coastal Plain regions of the MLRA. Pheba is in a taxonomic family all of its own.


Future Project Needs: 
Future Project: Gather transect and pedon for Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes.   
Future Project Needs: Determine if the Pheba that is mapped in 9-PNB is really Pheba or if should be correlated into another series or a new series has be developed. Reason for this study is due to the fact that Pheba is established in Clay County, MS and the series sporadically delineated throughout the 7 MET, 9-RUS to 9-PNB.
Future Project Needs: Conduct Ksat study ot Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 % slopes to have hard data from the 9-PNB region. 
Future Project Need: Look at Joins Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 percent have crossing into counties/parishes that do not have Pheba mapped.

Evaluation of map unit interpretations (subcategory interpretation)

Interpretation Join Issues:
No major Interpretation Join Issues were identified with harmonizing of Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes.


Evaluation of the map unit delineations (subcategory spatial)

Join Issues:
Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes have join issues where the map unit crosses from Ashley County, Arkansas to Morehouse Parish, Louisana. Morehouse Parish,LA doesnt have Pheba mapped in the county, but Pheba coming in from Ashley County, Arkansas. Also Pheba that is mapped in Dallas/Calhoun County, Arkansas comes into Cleveland County, Arkansas where Pheba isnt mapped in Cleveland County, Ark. Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes from Jefferson/Lincoln County, Arkansas comes into Cleveland County, Arkansas where Pheba isnt in Cleveland County, Arkansas.
Pheba silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes coming from Jefferson County, Arkansas coming into Grant County, Arkansas. Grant County, Ark.

Spatial Data Quality: 
Currently no known spatial issues are identified.

Slope Analysis: 
No spatial analysis was conducted.
Future Project Needs:
Some extensive revision of soil survey delineations is needed and the correction over the map unit extent of any glaring cartographic errors.

Describe Differences Between MLRA Map Unit and Map Units Being Harmonized:
The climatic data was the main inconsistency that was noted. But not significantly impacting interpretations.

Lab Data:
KSSL: Correlated pedons of Ruston (These pedons are not for the 3 to 8 percent slopes map unit) -- 61KY-035-001, 74-OK127-64-5, 74-OK127-64-6, 81LA027001, 81LA079001, 87LA059001, 87LA073001, 87LA079001, 87LA119008, 88LA013013, 90LA011013, S1945LA111001, S1957LA015001, S1957LA015002, S1966LA119001

Local: none

Pedon Data in NASIS:
There are 5 pedons in NASIS that support this map unit. These 5 pedons are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions (TUD) for the 5 map units correlated that are included in this project. Due to so few pedon descriptions for this map unit a field project is need to collect additional pedon/transect descriptions throughout the map units distribution.

Evaluation of Map Unit Interpretations:
The interpretations were consistent throughout the map units that are listed in this project.

Interpretation Join Issues:
The horizon data for the major component for this map unit was originally recorded in the soil interpretation record (SOI5 form-blue sheets). The data was then transferred to the 3SD system and eventually migrated to the NASIS database. Few changes have been made to the original data. The data evaluated in this project is essentially the data originally recorded for the series

Spatial Data Quality:
This map unit is located on the correct landform, however, the lines have been shifted somewhat. The soil lines need to be redrafted to place this map unit on the correct landform more accurately.

Slope Analysis:
No slope analysis conducted

Future Project Needs:
Project Name:  MLRA 133B  Ruston fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes

Additional items:

Describe Differences Between MLRA Map Unit and Map Units Being Harmonized:
There is some difference in minor components and geology across the area. 
Climatic data was different but edited to fit the distribution of the map unit.

Lab Data:

KSSL: There are no pedons sampled for the Sacul series in the project area. 

University: There are no pedons sampled for Sacul series in the project area.

Local: There are six pedons sampled for the Sacul series for BS and one for COLE in Rusk County. 

Pedon Data in NASIS:

	Number of Pedons: There are 3 pedons in Nasis that support this mapunit.

	Distribution of Pedons:	Pedons are poorly distributed throughout the range of the map unit and there is insufficient data.

	Number of Transects: There are no transects in Nasis that support this mapunit.

Distribution of Transects: 

	Since there is little pedon and no transect data in NASIS that supports this mapunit, the amount and distribution of the pedon descriptions and transect data is insufficient.  Additional pedon description and documentation spaced throughout the range of the mapunit is needed to sufficiently support the correlation of this mapunit.

Other Attribute Issues: Undifferentiated

This unit occurs mainly on the Claiborne and Wilcox group.  The Sparta, Cook Mountain, Yegua, and small areas of Weches are found in Houston County.  Reklaw, Queen City, Cook Mountain and small areas of Sparta are in Cherokee County.  Reklaw, Carrizo Sand, and small areas of Queen City and Wilcox are found in Rusk County. It could be that the soil delineations do not actually occur on all of these formations but the scale of the geology map does not allow such small geological units to be shown.  A future field project is needed to determine which geology this units belongs on.

Evaluation of Map Unit Interpretations

Interpretation Join Issues:

	The horizon data for the major component for this map unit in every survey was originally recorded in the soil interpretation record (SOL5 form -- blue sheet).  The data was then transferred to the 3SD system and eventually migrated to the NASIS database.  Few changes have been made to the original data.  The data evaluated in this project is essentially the data originally recorded for the series.

Spatial Data Quality: 

	This map unit is located mainly on nearly level to very gently sloping interfluves on the Coastal Plain. It is mapped on interfluves and on heads of drains which are the correct landforms.  Some areas that are ridges or steeper slopes may be incorrectly mapped or the lines may have been shifted somewhat and over mapped in some areas.  The soil lines need to be redrafted in some areas to place the map unit on the correct landform more accurately.

Slope Analysis: 

	None performed


Future Project Needs:

	Future Project Name:

	MLRA 133B - Sacul on Summit - Field Project

Series: Sacul
Classification: Fine, mixed, active, thermic Aquic Hapludults 

Type Location:  Ouachita County, Arkansas
Geology: mapped mainly in the Claiborne, Jackson and Wilcox groups.  
Landform: Occurs on interfluves on loamy and clayey fluviomarine sediments of Tertiary Age

Texture and Slope:
There are two texture phases: fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam
There are four slope ranges: 1 - 3%, 1 - 5%, 2 - 5%, and 3 - 8%
There is also an urban phase

Geology
The Sacul fine sandy loam is mapped on interfluves and the geology map shows it is mapped on Queen City, Reklaw, Wilcox, and Yegua geologies in northeast Texas, southwest and southern central Arkansas, and northwest Louisiana.  Smaller areas have been mapped on the Sparta geology in northeast Texas. The geology maps in northeast Texas, southwest Arkansas, and northwest Louisiana lack a lot of detail due to the scale in which they were produced as compared to soils surveys.  The soils mapped in the soil surveys are small in size and the geologies are not accurately reflected. 

The Sacul series has a ""water table"" described at 61 to 122 cm (2 to 4 ft) and is perched from Dec to April.  Field soil scientist that have mapped and described Sacul only note ""water tables"" where the soil occurs at the head of drains and or in a concave water receiving position. 

Proposed Project

A field project is needed to study the Sacul on the summit to:
1)	Determine which geology and landform Sacul should be mapped on
2)	Collect transects to determine map unit composition, determine minor components, and current taxonomic classification
3)	Collect lab data over the entire range of the soil to be able to adequately populate NASIS with correct data
4)	Collect saturated hydraulic conductivity data to adequately populate NASIS
5)	Collect pedon data to be able to adequately determine the range of characteristics for the series
6)	Determine if a new series or two is needed for the soils on any of the geologies or landforms on which the Sacul is currently mapped or if the lines on the geology maps are off
7)	Determine the predominate slope phases and how many are needed  
8)  Determine the correct texture phase or if two are needed
9)	Determine the soil moisture to adequately populate NASIS
10)	Correct line placement spatially to return soil delineations to correct landform
11)	Correct map miss-joins across survey areas
12) Determine proper depth class (very deep and/or deep), solum thickness, C horizon suffixes (C, Cd, Cr) and definitions for C material descriptions
13) Determine if the Sacul as it is mapped has a ""water table"" and is indeed Sacul or it does not have a ""water table"" and it is another series or if in the concave head of drain positions have a ""water table"" and the other positions do not have a ""water table"". If the Sacul does not have a ""water table"" determine which series would best fit the soil or if a new series is needed.

The description and data in this report below are historical information that documents the mapunit concept description the last time it was updated.  The information in this report below should not be used for any official use of soil information except as an archived description of the concept of the soil map unit.

Mapunit concept notes and issues:  This very deep, moderately well drained soil occurs on interfluves and uplands in the Coastal Plains. This map unit is correlated in MLRA 133B and 135B. At this time the map unit correlated in MLRA 135B will not be included in this project, further data is needed to determine if it should be harmonized with the map unit in MLRA 133B. 
Climatic data was edited to fit the range for correlated map units througout its distribution in MLRA 133B. 
The LL & PI were not changed becasue of statement in CHECK2HOR LL & PI; l,rv,h versus derived (New Algor) htm?-Comparison of Stored vs Calculated - LL and PI. IF POPULATED LL or PI DONT MATCH CALCULATED VALUES, DONT CHANGE STORED VALUES WITHOUT ENGINEERING LAB DATA!!

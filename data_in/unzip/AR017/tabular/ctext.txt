Ecological Site Concept
Somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in thin loess or water reworked loess deposits on broad nearly level to gently sloping uplands and stream terraces. Potential soil limitations that could drive the ecological site processes could include a fragipan or restrictive layer, acidity, high water table or high exchangeable Al (Aluminum). This soil chemistry limitation is significant because, Aluminum (Al) toxicity limits production on strongly acidic soils, pH values at or below 5, toxic forms of Al solubilized into the soil solution, inhibiting root growth and function (Kochian, 2005). The site includes multiple historic communities, Prairie and Woodland (If fire is excluded it will maintain a Forest community, if burned Prairie community or open woodland with a herbaceous understory). Cherrybark oak, Delta Post oak, Loblolly pine and Black gum are species that would historically colonize the site.

Soil Features
Soils are somewhat poorly drained, Aquic Fraglossudalfs (Calloway) and Aquic Glossudalfs (Egypt). These soils formed from mixed loess and loamy sediments or water reworked loess deposits of late Pleistocene Age. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. These very deep, slowly permeable soils are found on low ridges and knolls of broad, nearly level to gently sloping uplands and stream terraces. These soils are not considered hydric and the perched water table is at or within 0.5 to 2.0 feet of the surface during winter and spring months in normal years. These soils are not subject to flooding.

Reference Community
Cherrybark Oak, Delta Post Oak, Loblolly Pine, Black Gum. Community species would have a range of wetness tolerance from Black Gum up to Cherrybark oak and Loblolly pine in the driest areas of the site.

Ecological Site Concept
Somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in thin loess or water reworked loess deposits on broad nearly level to gently sloping uplands and stream terraces. Potential soil limitations that could drive the ecological site processes could include a fragipan or restrictive layer, acidity, high water table or high exchangeable Al (Aluminum).

The site includes multiple historic communities, Prairie and Woodland (If fire is excluded it will maintain a Forest community, if burned Prairie community or open woodland with a herbaceous understory).

Ecological Site Concept
The site is characterized 0 to 5% slopes of Moderately Well Drained to Well Drained soils found on higher landscape positions of loess influence on the Macon Ridge. Potential Soil Limitations that may be found on the site could include fragipan or restrictive layers and/or high exchangeable Al (Aluminum). This soil chemistry limitation is significant because, Aluminum (Al) toxicity limits production on strongly acidic soils, pH values at or below 5, toxic forms of Al solubilized into the soil solution, inhibiting root growth and function (Kochian 2005). Potential species composition of this site will include White oak, Delta Post Oak, Cherrybark Oak, Shagbark Hickory, Shumard Oak, Swamp Chestnut, Sycamore, Loblolly Pine and Sweetgum. This site has been described as a very diverse Upland Community.

Soil Features
Soils are well drained, Ultic Hapludalfs (Goodwill), well drained, Typic Hapludalfs (Memphis), moderately well drained, Typic Fragiudalfs (Gigger), moderately well drained, Oxyaquic Fraglossudalfs (Grenada), and moderately well drained, Oxyaquic Fragiudalfs (Loring). These soils formed from thick loess deposits and mixed thin loess and loamy sediments of late Pleistocene Age. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These deep to very deep soils are found on long, narrow ridges, summits, and natural levees on nearly level to gently sloping uplands and stream terraces. These soils range from moderately permeable to slowly permeable (within the fragipan). These soils are not considered hydric. The moderately well drained fragipan soils have a seasonal perched water table 1.5 to 3.0 feet in depth and above the fragipan in winter and early spring in normal years. The well drained soils have a water table deeper than 6 feet. These soils are not subject to flooding. These soils have land use limitations: 1) rooting depth restriction due to the fragipan, and (2) susceptible to erosion due to silt loam surface texture and slopes greater than 3 percent.

Ecological Site Concept
The site is characterized 0 to 5% slopes of Moderately Well Drained to Well Drained soils found on higher landscape positions of loess influence on the Macon Ridge. Potential Soil Limitations that may be found on the site could include fragipan or restrictive layers and/or high exchangeable Al (Aluminum). This soil chemistry limitation is significant because, Aluminum (Al) toxicity limits production on strongly acidic soils, pH values at or below 5, toxic forms of Al solubilized into the soil solution, inhibiting root growth and function (Kochian 2005). Potential species composition of this site will include White oak, Delta Post Oak, Cherrybark Oak, Shagbark Hickory, Shumard Oak, Swamp Chestnut, Sycamore, Loblolly Pine and Sweetgum. This site has been described as a very diverse Upland Community.

Soil Features
Soils are well drained, Ultic Hapludalfs (Goodwill), well drained, Typic Hapludalfs (Memphis), moderately well drained, Typic Fragiudalfs (Gigger), moderately well drained, Oxyaquic Fraglossudalfs (Grenada), and moderately well drained, Oxyaquic Fragiudalfs (Loring). These soils formed from thick loess deposits and mixed thin loess and loamy sediments of late Pleistocene Age. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These deep to very deep soils are found on long, narrow ridges, summits, and natural levees on nearly level to gently sloping uplands and stream terraces. These soils range from moderately permeable to slowly permeable (within the fragipan). These soils are not considered hydric. The moderately well drained fragipan soils have a seasonal perched water table 1.5 to 3.0 feet in depth and above the fragipan in winter and early spring in normal years. The well drained soils have a water table deeper than 6 feet. These soils are not subject to flooding. These soils have land use limitations: 1) rooting depth restriction due to the fragipan, and (2) susceptible to erosion due to silt loam surface texture and slopes greater than 3 percent.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Floodplain ecological site has loamy-textured, very deep, somewhat poorly to well drained soils that are prone to flooding. Sites can flood for prolonged periods, especially during the winter and early spring. 

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, somewhat poorly to well drained, very slow to moderately permeable soils. Most of the soils have a silt loam surface, but can range from very fine sandy loam to silty clay loam. Soils correlated to this site include: Caspiana, Commerce, Coushatta, Dardanelle, Gallion, Hebert, Keo, Mcgehee, Mer Rouge, Morganfield, Norwood, Oklared, Rilla, Roxana, Severn, and Sterlington.

Reference Community
Besides the co-dominants water oak and willow oak, associate species may include: sweetgum, Nuttall oak, overcup oak (Quercus lyrata), hackberry (Celtis laevigata), green ash, and red maple. Understory shrub species include: swamp dogwood (Cornus foemina), green hawthorn (Crataegus viridis), and possumhaw (Ilex decidua). Common understory herbaceous species include: peppervine (Ampelopsis arborea), trumpet-creeper (Campsis radicans), and poison ivy. Sedges and other herbaceous vegetation adapted to seasonally prolonged flooding inhabit the forest understory.

Delaney and Edgar,
According to NASIS database calculations, Newellton, Commerce, and Crevasse components of the Alluvial land, frequently flooded map unit should be considered hydric with criterion 4
1.	Map unit components that are frequently flooded for long duration or very long duration during the growing season that: 
a.	Based on the range of characteristics for the soil series, will at least in part meet one or more Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the United States, or
b.	Show evidence that the soils meet the definition of a hydric soil.

However, on the MS hydric soils list, the alluvial land map unit has only hydric components in the depressions.  I am inclined to leave these components as they currently stand:  not considered hydric because of this historic list and the potential programmatic problems this change would cause.  
Please let me know what you would like me to do about this.  I am not going to change anything to hydric solely based on a NASIS calculation. RSE

I agree with doing no harm.  When the alluvial land is done in a project, then handle the hydric.   EM

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Floodplain ecological site has clay-textured, very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils that are prone to flooding. Sites can flood for prolonged periods, especially during the winter and early spring.

Soil Features
The ecological site consists of very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained, very slowly permeable to impermeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium. The soils have high clay content with high shrink-swell potential. Soils correlated to this site include: Alligator, Desha, Forestdale, Perry, and Portland.

Reference Community
Besides the co-dominants overcup oak and water hickory, associate species may include: green ash, hackberry (Celtis laevigata), swamp dogwood (Cornus foemina), and swamp privet (Forestiera acuminata). Buttonbush is a common understory shrub. Sedges and other herbaceous vegetation adapted to seasonally prolonged flooding inhabit the forest understory.

Ecological Site Concept
The ecological site has very deep, very poorly drained soils that are ponded throughout a portion of the year. A wetland plant community exists because it is the lowest position on the landscape, along with the flooding and ponding regimes.

Soil Features
The Yorktown series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium. Only Yorktown is correlated to this ecological site. The taxonomic classification is a very-fine, smectitic, nonacid, thermic Vertic Epiaquept.

Reference Community
The vegetation that has adapted to the anaerobic conditions are dominant. The United State Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) classifies plants that occur in wetlands with an estimated probability greater than 99 percent obligate (OBL), and those 67 to 99 percent facultative wetland (FACW) plants. Obligate and facultative wetland plants are the most common encountered throughout the Swamps. When submerged, indicator species include coon's tail (Ceratophyllum demersum) and duckweeds (Azolla sp., Lemna sp., and Wolffia sp.). When the conditions are drier, or more near the periphery, indicator species are swamp smartweed (Polygonum hydropiperoides), marsh seedbox (Ludwigia palustris), and various sedges (Carex sp. and Cyperus sp.).

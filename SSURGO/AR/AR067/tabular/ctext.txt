03/27/2020 00:00:00|"Edit notes"|"data maintenance"||"NULL elevation was populated using a data file supplied by the NSSC.  The data file contained l, rv, h elevation that were the results of GIS zonal statistics analysis conducted on Digital Elevation Models for the spatial extent of the DMU.  NASIS calculation named Import Elevation was used to transfer the data to the NASIS component table, Elevation data element. 

Below are the general process steps the NSSC used to conduct the GIS analysis.
1.	All map unit polygons that had at least one major component with NULL RV FFD, MAAT, MAP, or elevation were selected from the FY20 gSSURGO MUPOLYGON feature class.  
2.	The NASIS data mapunit table record ID was joined to the gSSURGO polygon attribute table so the GIS analysis could be run on data mapunits.    This is important because a mukey is restricted to a soil survey area but often a data mapunit is linked to more than one mukey and straddles multiple soil survey areas.  We needed to analyze the spatial extent of the data mapunit.
3.	The polygons were analyzed against 10m elevation grids in GIS.  
4.	FFD, MAAT, and MAP analysis was conducted on all areas of the United States and Island Territories.  The elevation analysis excluded some of the Island Territories due to the lack 10 meter elevation layers.
5.	For MAAT, MAP, and FFD, we determined the 10%, 50%, and 90% quantiles.  The 10% equated to low, the 50% to RV, and the 90% to high.    
6.	For elevation, we determined the full extent of the low and high values and calculated the mean.  The mean value was equated to the RV.
7.	Lastly, the low, RV, and H values for FFD, MAAT, MAP, and elevation were rounded to avoid the implications of overly precise values.   MAP, elevation, and FFD were rounded to the nearest 5.  MAAT was rounded to the nearest whole number. For example, a MAP of 474 was rounded to 475 and a MAAT of 4.2 was rounded to 4.
8.	The final outputs are 4 pipe delimited text files, formatted to be recognized by THE NASIS calculations. 
9.	Four new NASIS calculations were written so the text files data could be imported into NASIS.  These are located in the Component folder and start with the word Import.

03/27/2020 00:00:00|"Edit notes"|"data maintenance"||"NULL elevation was populated using a data file supplied by the NSSC.  The data file contained l, rv, h elevation that were the results of GIS zonal statistics analysis conducted on Digital Elevation Models for the spatial extent of the DMU.  NASIS calculation named Import Elevation was used to transfer the data to the NASIS component table, Elevation data element. 

Below are the general process steps the NSSC used to conduct the GIS analysis.
1.	All map unit polygons that had at least one major component with NULL RV FFD, MAAT, MAP, or elevation were selected from the FY20 gSSURGO MUPOLYGON feature class.  
2.	The NASIS data mapunit table record ID was joined to the gSSURGO polygon attribute table so the GIS analysis could be run on data mapunits.    This is important because a mukey is restricted to a soil survey area but often a data mapunit is linked to more than one mukey and straddles multiple soil survey areas.  We needed to analyze the spatial extent of the data mapunit.
3.	The polygons were analyzed against 10m elevation grids in GIS.  
4.	FFD, MAAT, and MAP analysis was conducted on all areas of the United States and Island Territories.  The elevation analysis excluded some of the Island Territories due to the lack 10 meter elevation layers.
5.	For MAAT, MAP, and FFD, we determined the 10%, 50%, and 90% quantiles.  The 10% equated to low, the 50% to RV, and the 90% to high.    
6.	For elevation, we determined the full extent of the low and high values and calculated the mean.  The mean value was equated to the RV.
7.	Lastly, the low, RV, and H values for FFD, MAAT, MAP, and elevation were rounded to avoid the implications of overly precise values.   MAP, elevation, and FFD were rounded to the nearest 5.  MAAT was rounded to the nearest whole number. For example, a MAP of 474 was rounded to 475 and a MAAT of 4.2 was rounded to 4.
8.	The final outputs are 4 pipe delimited text files, formatted to be recognized by THE NASIS calculations. 
9.	Four new NASIS calculations were written so the text files data could be imported into NASIS.  These are located in the Component folder and start with the word Import.

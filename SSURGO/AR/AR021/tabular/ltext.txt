More pedon data needs to be collected for complete aggregation of all map units.


3) Map Unit Composition.
Transect data need to be collected on all map units for a comprehensive component composition.

County Summary:
* Will update fairly easy.
* Geology breaks need to be made.
* Base saturation studies need to be made as related to geology and map units.
* Map units need finer slope breaks.

02/23/2009 00:00:00|"Miscellaneous notes"|"evaluation"|"interpretation"|"1) Known Deficiencies.
* Flooding needs to be addressed and water table studies conducted.
* All large scarp slopes on terraces need to have a line feature added or a polygon feature added if large enough.
* Leveled lands need to be investigated.
* Foot slope soil units along Crowleys Ridge need to be reevaluated.
* Bosket in the western lowlands does appear to be Mollic.
* Water table studies need to be conducted on all geomorphic landforms.

7)  The Soil-Landscape Model.
Summary:
Needs extensive work."|"15098"|"76912"
02/23/2009 00:00:00|"Miscellaneous notes"|"evaluation"|"spatial"|"4) GIS Evaluation of Line Placement.
* Kobel has depressional areas and shade differences
* MMA boundary needs adjusting, the ridge is split and does not follow a physiographic landform
* Natural levee soils need adjusting to break
* Levees need delineating
* Amagon has depressional areas and shade differences
* Water levee needs to be combined
* Ridge line could be delineated
* Loring at the foot slopes
* Foley may be over mapped
* Bottoms into hills needs adjusting
* Loring crosses landforms
* Need an urban land complex
* Fountain may be over mapped


5) Field Verification.
* Most of the mapping appears fairly good.
* Slope breaks need refined.
* Series need to be confined geologically.
* Flood plains, stream terraces, toe slopes need the most work.

Mapunit Name - Amagon silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 131A:  Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in seven counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Craighead (AR031), Cross (AR037), Clay (AR021), Monroe (AR095), Randolph (AR121), Poinsett (AR111) and Woodruff (AR147). The series was established in Calloway County, Kentucky in 1937. The OSD Type Location is in Madison County, Mississippi. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1118 to 1270 mm (44 to 50 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 8.8 to 22.2 degrees C (48 to 72 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 195 to 290 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
The Amagon soils are on low terraces in the Southern Mississippi River Alluvium. 

Minor Component:  
The minor component 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' occur in similar positions as the Amagon soils. The 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' are mostly comprised of Aqualfs (Order: Alfisol; Suborder: Aqualfs). 

Parent Material:
Loamy alluvium

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This soil is suitable for crop production and pastureland. The predominant crops grown on this soil are cotton, soybeans, rice and grain sorghum. Pasture grasses grown include common and improved bermudagrasses and tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Amagon: 90 percent
Unnamed Hydric Soils: 10 percent 
This mapunit is supported by eight pedon descriptions. These eight pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the seven counties where this mapunit is correlated (one of these pedon descriptions is a duplicate). 

Classification:
Amagon classification: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Endoaqualfs 

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Amagon soils in this mapunit consist of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium on low terraces. They have a seasonal water table perched within 12 inches of the surface from December through April in most years. Dominant slope gradients are between 0 and 1 percent. 

Reaction: Reaction is moderately acid through strongly acid in the surface and moderately acid through slightly alkaline in the subsoil.

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Amagon was reviewed for SDJR. 

Spatial Data Quality:
Joins between Arkansas counties will need to be investigated. Spatial distribution is slighlty irregular. An attempt should also be made to join this map unit to Amagon silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (Natl MU Sym: 2pqqq) in Missouri

The Collins series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils. They formed in silty alluvium on flood plains of streams in the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands Major Land Resource Area. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.

Minor Components:  

Aquents soils are in slightly lower positions on the flood plain. They are deep, well drained, and moderately permeable.  The surface layer is brown or dark yellowish brown silt loam and the subsoil is yellowish brown and brown silt loam.


Parent Material:
Coarse-silty alluvium washed from loess covered uplands

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
Most areas of this mapunit are used for crop production. The main crop is soybeans. Some areas are used for corn, pasture, or hay. A few areas support hardwoods. Other suitable crops include grain sorghum and water-tolerant grasses, such as tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Collins: 94 percent
Aquents: 6 percent 
The mapunit composition was determined from a review of the manuscripts of Clay, Craighead, and Poinsett Counties, Arkansas, and from Stoddard County, MO. and from knowledge of those landscapes and soils. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from four to one.
This mapunit is supported by four pedon descriptions.  The Collins pedons are the typifying pedons from the four counties where this mapunit is correlated. 

Classification:
Major Component:
Collins classification: Coarse-silty, mixed, active, acid, thermic Aquic Udifluvents
The Collins series was established in 1906 in Prairie County, Arkansas.
Minor Components:
Aquents - only classified to the family level


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
Collins soils are very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils. They formed in silty alluvium on flood plains of streams in the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands Major Land Resource Area. They have a high available water holding capacity, medium natural fertility and range from strongly acid to very strongly acid in all horizons. These soils flood occasionally, usually for several days at a time in the winter and spring, and the water table stays at a depth of 2 feet or more during this time period. The rooting zone is deep during the summer months but is somewhat restricted by the water table during the winter and spring months. 

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The Official Series Description for Collins was reviewed for SDJR. No revisions were needed.

Future work on this map unit will be needed. As with all flood plain map units, further evaluation is needed of spatial joins across state and county boundaries.  Additionally, the exact content of the Aquents component should be investigated to try to put a series name on it.

Spatial Data Quality:
An evaluation of joins is needed between where this map unit exists and the adjoining counties/states. Possible mis-joins would relate to differences in slope class, flooding frequency, and flooding duration are possible. "|"564052"|"2409221"

Mapunit Name - Commerce soils, 0 to 1 percent slopes, frequently flooded

MLRA 131A:  Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in three counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Clay (AR021), Craighead (AR031), Lee (AR077), and Monroe (AR095)). The series was established in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana in 1948. The OSD Type Location is in Tensas Parish, Louisiana. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1245 to 1321 mm (49 to 52 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 9.4 to 22.2 degrees C (49 to 72 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 230 to 295 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
Commerce soils are on the lower part of convex natural levee positions on the alluvial plain of the Mississippi River and its distributaries. Slope gradients are mainly less than 1 percent. 

Minor Components:  
The minor component 'Aquepts' are slighlty lower than Commerce soils, occuring on nearly level to slightly depressed areas on flood plains. The 'Aquepts' component was built using the concept of the Mhoon series (Order: Inceptisols; Suborder: Aquepts). Field work is needed to determine a better composition of minor components for this map unit.

Parent Material:
Alluvium

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This soil is suitable for crop production. The predominant crop grown on this soil is soybeans. Pasture grasses grown include common and improved bermudagrasses and tall fescue. Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Commerce: 90 percent
Aquepts: 10 percent 
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. Aquepts as a minor component replaces Mhoon and Aquents as a minor component. This is due to updates to taxonomy since this survey was originally published. Field work is needed to determine which minor components are the best fit for this map unit. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from three to one.
This mapunit is supported by six pedon descriptions. These six pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the six counties where this mapunit is correlated (some of these pedon descriptions are duplicates). 

Classification:
Commerce classification: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Commerce soils in this mapunit consist of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from the Mississippi River and its distributaries. The soil is saturated in layers below 1.5 to 4 feet during December to April in normal years. Commerce soils are somewhat poorly drained; runoff is low in slopes less than 1 percent.

Reaction: Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the surface. The upper part of the subsoil ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. The lower part of the subsoil is moderately alkaline. 

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Commerce was reviewed for SDJR. 

Spatial Data Quality:
Joins between Arkansas counties where this map unit does not exist should be investigated. Joins should also be investigated between Arkansas and Missouri.

Geographic Extent: These mapping units are level to gently sloping natural levees and low terraces along former channels of the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium Major Land Resource Area; MLRA 131


Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 894 to 1545 mm (35 to 61 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 8.8 to 21.6 degrees C (48 to 71 degrees F)

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: level to gently sloping soils on natural levees and low terraces along former channels of the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium Major Land Resource Area


Minor Components: 
Aquents: small narrow drainageways on terrace treads
Amagon: low concave depressions on terrace treads 


Parent Material: loamy alluvium


Typical Vegetation or Crops: row crops - Corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, and wheat. Pasture/hayland crops - tall fescue, improved bermudagrass
 

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Dundee   89%
Amagon    6%
Aquents   5%
 

Classification: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Endoaqualfs 


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations: Typically the surface is Dark grayish brown, friable silt loam; the subsurface is grayish brown friable silt loam; the upper part of the subsoil is grayish brown friable silt loam, the lower subsoil is firm, grayish brown silty clay loam; the lower solum and parent material is friable light grayish brown silt loam. 


Reaction: Surface layer - Extremely acid to moderately except where limed; Subsurface and subsoil layers - very strongly acid to moderately acid; parent material (below solum) very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR: Aquents component does not occur in all mapunit represented in this project. However, most of these mapunits are on very large terrace treads that do have small narrow drainageways that have narrow flood plains, and Amagon would be similar to most aqualf components, thus aquents was chosen to be an RV component.


Spatial Data Quality: Numerous county line joins need to be investigated. Many misjoins are simply slope related.

MLRA 134  Southern Mississippi Valley Loess

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in five counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Clay (AR021), Craighead (AR031), Greene (AR055), Lee (AR077) and Poinsett (AR111). The OSD is located in Fayette County, TN. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1118 to 1295 mm (44 to 51 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 9.7 to 21.4 degrees C (48 to 71 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 211 to 295 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
The Falaya soils are on flood plains. They have a layer in which the dominant colors have a chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 20 inches. The surface layer is brown silt loam and the subsoil ranges from light brownish gray to gray silt loam. 

Minor Components:  
'Unnamed Hydric Soils' are in similar positions on flood plains. 

Parent Material:
Coarse-silty alluvium washed from loess covered uplands

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
Most areas of this mapunit are used for crop production. Suitable crops include soybeans, corn, cotton, grain sorghum. This soil is also suited for pasture, or hay. Suitable forage crops include bermudagrass and tall fescue. A few areas support hardwoods. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Falaya: 95 percent
Unnamed Hydric Soils: 5 percent 
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions of those map units around which this SDJR project was centered. The minor component 'Unnamed Hydric Soils' was used until such time that minor component composition can be investigated more thoroughly in the field. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from five to one.
This mapunit is supported by six pedon descriptions. These six pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the two counties where this mapunit is correlated (one of which is a duplicate). 


Classification:
Major Component:
Falaya classification: Coarse-silty, mixed, active, acid, thermic Aeric Fluvaquents
The Falaya series was established in 1950 in Quitman County, Mississippi.

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Falaya soils in this mapunit are deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils formed in coarse-silty alluvium washed from loess covered uplands. They have a high available water holding capacity, medium natural fertility and range from strongly acid to very strongly acid. These soils flood occasionally, usually for several days at a time in the winter and spring, and the water table stays at a depth of 1 to 2 feet during this time period. The rooting zone is deep during the summer months but is restricted by the water table during the winter and spring months. This soil is not suited to most urban uses because of the susceptibility to flooding and the seasonal high water table.


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The Official Series Description for Falaya was reviewed for SDJR. No revisions were needed.


Spatial Data Quality:

Frost-free period: 190 to 260 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting: Jackport soils occur on broad low terraces of the Mississippi delta.  Typically, the surface layer is dark grayish brown, mottled silty clay about 5 inches thick.  The upper part of the subsoil is grayish brown, mottled silty clay about 11 inches thick; the middle part is grayish brown, mottled clay about 21 inches thick; the lower part is olive gray silty clay about 19 inches thick.  The underlying material is olive gray, mottled silty clay that extends to a depth of 72 inches or more.

Major Component: Jackport silty clay


Minor Components:  

Aqualfs - is slightly higher positions
Aquepts - in slightly lower positions


Parent Material: Clayey alluvium (sometimes overlying loamy alluvium)


Typical Vegetation or Crops: Most of the acreage of this soil is used for cropland, mainly soybeans. Other common crops include rice, grain sorghum, and cotton. Fescue is the principal pasture crops. 
 

Mapunit Composition and Reliability: 

Major: Jackport 90%
Minor: aqualfs   5%
	   aquepts   5%
	   
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from two to one.
This mapunit is supported by two pedon descriptions. These two pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the two counties where this mapunit is correlated. 

Classification: FINE, SMECTITIC, THERMIC CHROMIC EPIAQUERTS 


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Jackport series was established in Jackson County, Arkansas in 1941.

Reaction: Very strongly acid to Slightly acid


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The Jackport series is mapped in two different surface phases in Arkansas and misjoins are likely.  The heavier silty clay phase is limited to the northern extent of the range of the series, but flanks the lighter silty clay loam phase in two northern Arkansas counties.


Spatial Data Quality:
Potential mis-joins occur at county lines and should be studied as a future project.

2) All counties except one in this project indicated 100% Loring. Our experience shows this is unlikely. The one county that did show minor inclusions, indicated Dundee and Amagon. Based on the fact that these polygons are upland phased, it is thought that this is a line work error, not a map unit content error. Investigation should be made for minor inclusions in this map unit.

3) Absence of this map unit in Greene County is suspicious and should be investigated. It is largely an erosion factor error.

4) As in most projects, the crop yields in NASIS do not reflect modern, best practice yield expectations. These should be update to modern figures.

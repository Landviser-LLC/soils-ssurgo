More pedon data needs to be collected for complete aggregation of all map units.


3) Map Unit Composition.
* Transect data need to be collected on all map units for a comprehensive component composition.

County Summary:
* Will update fairly easy.
* Geology breaks need to be made.
* Base saturation studies need to be made as related to geology and map units.
* Map units need finer slope breaks.

* Flooding needs to be addressed and water table studies conducted.
* All large scarp slopes on terraces need to have a line feature added or a polygon feature added if large enough.
* Leveled lands need to be investigated.
* Foot slope soil units along Crowleys Ridge need to be reevaluated.
* Bosket in the western lowlands does appear to be Mollic.
* Water table studies need to be conducted on all geomorphic landforms.

* Crowley-Hillemann-Henry:Somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained, level or nearly level soils
* Calloway-Henry-Loring:Moderately well drained to poorly drained, level to gently sloping soil that have a compact, brittle subsoil (fragipan)

5) Field Verification.
* Most of the mapping appears fairly good.
* Slope breaks need refined.
* Series need to be confined geologically.
* Flood plains, stream terraces, toe slopes need the most work.
* Falaya on the foot slopes and in the drains.
* Memphis on rolling plain and on the ridge.
* Loring on the loess plains and on the ridge."|"15105"|"76964"

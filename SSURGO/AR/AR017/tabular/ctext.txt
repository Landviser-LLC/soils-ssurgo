Ecological Site Concept
The ecological site has very deep, very poorly drained soils that are ponded throughout a portion of the year. A wetland plant community exists because it is the lowest position on the landscape, along with the flooding and ponding regimes.

Soil Features
The Yorktown series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium. Only Yorktown is correlated to this ecological site. The taxonomic classification is a very-fine, smectitic, nonacid, thermic Vertic Epiaquept.

Reference Community
The vegetation that has adapted to the anaerobic conditions are dominant. The United State Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) classifies plants that occur in wetlands with an estimated probability greater than 99 percent obligate (OBL), and those 67 to 99 percent facultative wetland (FACW) plants. Obligate and facultative wetland plants are the most common encountered throughout the Swamps. When submerged, indicator species include coon's tail (Ceratophyllum demersum) and duckweeds (Azolla sp., Lemna sp., and Wolffia sp.). When the conditions are drier, or more near the periphery, indicator species are swamp smartweed (Polygonum hydropiperoides), marsh seedbox (Ludwigia palustris), and various sedges (Carex sp. and Cyperus sp.).

Delaney and Edgar,
According to NASIS database calculations, Newellton, Commerce, and Crevasse components of the Alluvial land, frequently flooded map unit should be considered hydric with criterion 4
1.	Map unit components that are frequently flooded for long duration or very long duration during the growing season that: 
a.	Based on the range of characteristics for the soil series, will at least in part meet one or more Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the United States, or
b.	Show evidence that the soils meet the definition of a hydric soil.

However, on the MS hydric soils list, the alluvial land map unit has only hydric components in the depressions.  I am inclined to leave these components as they currently stand:  not considered hydric because of this historic list and the potential programmatic problems this change would cause.  
Please let me know what you would like me to do about this.  I am not going to change anything to hydric solely based on a NASIS calculation. RSE

I agree with doing no harm.  When the alluvial land is done in a project, then handle the hydric.   EM
I agree to let stay as is. One reason, this is atypical of the landscape, setting and concept (riverside) for the subject taxonomic units. DJ"|"21851290"|"22163869"

Ecological Site Concept
The Loess Terrace is a diverse grassland prairie. A fragipan layer exists two to three feet below that surface that restricts root growth and perches water. Vegetative species are adapted to the restrictive layer.

Soil Features
The ecological site consists of very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in thick loess. These soils have a fragipan between 28 and 37 inches deep that restrict root growth and perch water during winter and early in spring.

Delaney and Edgar,
According to NASIS database calculations, Newellton, Commerce, and Crevasse components of the Alluvial land, frequently flooded map unit should be considered hydric with criterion 4
1.	Map unit components that are frequently flooded for long duration or very long duration during the growing season that: 
a.	Based on the range of characteristics for the soil series, will at least in part meet one or more Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the United States, or
b.	Show evidence that the soils meet the definition of a hydric soil.

However, on the MS hydric soils list, the alluvial land map unit has only hydric components in the depressions.  I am inclined to leave these components as they currently stand:  not considered hydric because of this historic list and the potential programmatic problems this change would cause.  
Please let me know what you would like me to do about this.  I am not going to change anything to hydric solely based on a NASIS calculation. RSE

I agree with doing no harm.  When the alluvial land is done in a project, then handle the hydric.   EM
I agree to let stay as is. One reason, this is atypical of the landscape, setting and concept (riverside) for the subject taxonomic units. DJ"|"21851289"|"22163866"

Delaney and Edgar,
According to NASIS database calculations, Newellton, Commerce, and Crevasse components of the Alluvial land, frequently flooded map unit should be considered hydric with criterion 4
1.	Map unit components that are frequently flooded for long duration or very long duration during the growing season that: 
a.	Based on the range of characteristics for the soil series, will at least in part meet one or more Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the United States, or
b.	Show evidence that the soils meet the definition of a hydric soil.

However, on the MS hydric soils list, the alluvial land map unit has only hydric components in the depressions.  I am inclined to leave these components as they currently stand:  not considered hydric because of this historic list and the potential programmatic problems this change would cause.  
Please let me know what you would like me to do about this.  I am not going to change anything to hydric solely based on a NASIS calculation. RSE

I agree with doing no harm.  When the alluvial land is done in a project, then handle the hydric.   EM
I agree to let stay as is. One reason, this is atypical of the landscape, setting and concept (riverside) for the subject taxonomic units. DJ"|"21851287"|"22163861"

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Floodplain ecological site has clay-textured, very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils that are prone to flooding. Sites can flood for prolonged periods, especially during the winter and early spring.

Soil Features
The ecological site consists of very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained, very slowly permeable to impermeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium. The soils have high clay content with high shrink-swell potential. Soils correlated to this site include: Alligator, Desha, Forestdale, Perry, and Portland.

Reference Community
Besides the co-dominants overcup oak and water hickory, associate species may include: green ash, hackberry (Celtis laevigata), swamp dogwood (Cornus foemina), and swamp privet (Forestiera acuminata). Buttonbush is a common understory shrub. Sedges and other herbaceous vegetation adapted to seasonally prolonged flooding inhabit the forest understory.

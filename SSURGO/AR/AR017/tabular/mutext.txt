MLRA:  131B Arkansas River Alluvium

Geographic Extent:
The McGehee silt loam; map units in MLRA(s) 131B are in this Soil Data Join Recorrelation (SDJR) project. These map units are correlated in Desha, Jefferson, Lincoln Counties in Arkansas.The total map unit acres in this project are 44,054, and the SDJR reportable acres are 8,811.

Geographic Setting: 
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic
Mean annual precipitation: 1121 to 1614mm
Mean annual air temperature: 11. 1 to 23.5 degrees C 
Frost-free period: 230 to 290 days
Elevation: 30 to 73 meters 

Geomorphic Setting: 
Major Component(s):
The McGehee Silt loam  soils occur in thick silty and clayey alluvium, near the Arkansas River.. 

Minor Components:  
 Perry soils is on similar landscape with a clayey texture
 Herbert soils and Unnamed Hydric Component are on similar landscapes McGehee series.

Parent Material and Geology:
Arkansas and Red River Alluvium in the Holocene Geological formation

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This soil has high potential for row crops and small
grains. The main crops are cotton, soybeans, and rice.
Other suitable crops are corn and grain sorghum.
Adapted pasture plants are bermudagrass and tall fescue.
The soil responds well to fertilization. Farming operations
are delayed a few days after a rain because of excess
water, and surface drains are needed.
This soil has high potential for hardwood trees such as
eastern cottonwood, cherrybark oak, water oak, willow
oak, and sweetgum.


Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
McGehee soils and similar soils: 85 percent
Herbert and similar soils: 5 percent 
Perry and similar soils: 5 percent
Unnamed Hydric Component: 5 percent

The mapunit composition was estimated from the mapunit description in the published manuscripts and needs to be verified with transects in a future MLRA project.

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:

Typically, the surface layer is dark brown silt loam
about 7 inches thick. The upper part of the subsoil extends
to a depth of about 14 inches. It is grayish brown, mottled silt loam. The middle part is reddish brown, mottled
silty clay loam that extends to a depth of about 30
inches. The lower part, extending to a depth of 60 inches
or more, is dark reddish brown silty clay.

Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Percent of area covered by surface fragments: None specified
Depth to first water and root restrictive layer: No restrictive layer
Slowest soil permeability to 60 inches, above first water and root restrictive layer: Slow (0.06 to 0.2 in/hr)
Slowest permeability from first water and root restrictive layer to 60 inches: No restrictive layer, so the results above are the most restrictive class
Shrink-swell potential, weighted average of representative value linear extensibility percentage (LEP) in 10 to 60 inches: High. (6.2 LEP)
Representative total available water capacity to 60 inches: High (About 10.7 inches)
Natural drainage class: Somewhat poorly drained
Runoff class: Low
Flooding frequency: None

22-McGehee silt loam. This somewhat poorly drained,
level soil is on low terraces and natural levees. Slope is
less than 1 percent. Individual areas are 20 to 400 acres.
Typically, the surface layer is dark brown silt loam
about 7 inches thick. The upper part of the subsoil extends
to a depth of about 14 inches. It is grayish brown, mottled silt loam. The middle part is reddish brown, mottled
silty clay loam that extends to a depth of about 30
inches. The lower part, extending to a depth of 60 inches
or more, is dark reddish brown silty clay.
Included with this soil in mapping are small areas of
Rilla, Hebert, Portland, and Perry soils. These included
soils make up less than 10 percent of the unit.
This soil is high in natural fertility. Reaction is strongly
acid or medium acid in the surface layer and in the upper
part of the subsoil and slightly acid to moderately alkaline
in the lower part of the subsoil and in the underlying
material. Permeability is slow, and available water capacity
is high. Tilth is easy to maintain.
This soil has high potential for row crops and small
grains. The main crops are cotton, soybeans, and rice.
Other suitable crops are corn and grain sorghum.
Adapted pasture plants are bermudagrass and tall fescue.
The soil responds well to fertilization. Farming operations
are delayed a few days after a rain because of excess
water, and surface drains are needed.
This soil has high potential for hardwood trees such as
eastern cottonwood, cherrybark oak, water oak, willow
oak, and sweetgum. Wetness is a moderate limitation to
equipment use in managing and harvesting the tree crop,
but is usually overcome by logging during the dry
seasons.
This soil has low potential for most urban uses. Wetness
and shrink-swell potential are severe limitations for
dwellings, streets, and industrial sites. Slow permeability
and wetness are severe limitations for septic tank absorption
fields. These limitations are difficult or impractical to
overcome. Capability unit Ilw-3; woodland suitability

When the Metcalfe MLRA SSO was set up in 2005, the project leader and staff immediately began formulating future MRLA projects based on updating the out-of-date soil survey publications to meet current needs of the district and area conservationists for Farm Bill Program planning and implementation.  One of the projects on the list was the alluvial land or alluvial soils within the Mississippi River levees.  Several DCs asked when we were going to map those areas so that theyd have useful data.  Other projects superseded that request until I received a phone call in early 2013 from the WRP team member and Area Forester, asking about this alluvial land and specific soil types suitable for planting certain tree species.  
To show how much land use has changed in the last 60 to 70 years, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when the counties in the Mississippi Delta (Yazoo Basin) were being mapped, most of the land inside the river levees was forested in original bottomland hardwood forest (Figures 1 and 2).  Very little land was cleared and very little land was being farmed.  What was cleared and farmed was mapped accordingly, while the rest of the forested area was outlined and named Alluvial land or Alluvial soils, described in the manuscripts as frequently flooded in spring and early summer, with many different soils, principle soil series were Commerce, Crevasse, Robinsonville, and Tunica, ranging in texture from sand to clay and in drainage from excessive to poor (Wynn, 1959).  Land use changed, and these areas were harvested for timber production, cleared, and now have been farmed for the last 40 to 50 years.  Farmers make a decent crop on these soils every two or three years out of five.  Other land inside the levee that is not cleared is used for hunting.  The emphasis of programs has shifted from wood production to ecosystem restoration and ecosystem services.  Many landowners now want to restore this cleared land back to hardwoods, using the Wetlands Reserve Program.  
In order to assist the foresters and WRP team, I researched the Alluvial Land/Soils map unit in Bolivar and Coahoma Counties in the NASIS database.  There were no components listed, no flooding frequency, no data behind this mapunit.  Unfortunately, this was the case in four MS Delta counties:  172,000 acres with four identical map units with no component data or soil names, basically unmapped.  Also 28,688 acres of Mixed Alluvial Land are mapped in Chicot County, AR.  
Our Area Forester and State Forester had real world problems in restoring a tract of land in the Wetland Reserve Program and/or the Wetland Reserve Enhancement Program.  To follow WRP guidelines, he needed to match tree species to soil series, and Alluvial Land is a miscellaneous unit, which cannot be interpreted.  Soil-site relationships are of utmost importance in selecting bottomland hardwood species for reforestation in terms of slope, drainage class, flooding and duration, and pH (Baker and Broadfoot, 1979).  He needed to know how many acres of each soil series was out there in that tract, to order tree species quantities, and he needed to know the elevation and where these soils are positioned to plant each tree species.  
For each of these tracts, using LiDAR and GIS, I clipped the areas in question, and made LiDAR elevation contours, and then drew a pre-map.  Each tract took about a day or day and a half  for me to ground-truth the pre-map; I bored holes with a hand auger across transect lines, making notes and fairly complete 232 soil pedon descriptions at each auger hole.  Back at the office, it took another day of GIS work to finish the soil map.  The end product that I gave to the area and state foresters was a draft initial order 3 soil survey map for the WRP team to use in planning tree species plantings (Figure 5).  The maps outlined the soils suitable for cottonwood plantings, according to state guidelines (Figure 6).  
This type of Technical Soil Service activity is not a typical request (usually two of these a year).  When the area forester or state forester calls for assistance, I do what I can to help.  Drafting an order 3 initial soil survey map for a WRP tract inside the levee helps them match soil type to tree species and close on a tract, positively impacting the Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watershed Initiative, and it keeps up my mapping skills.   Moreover, it highlights the need of a future MLRA project to completely remap the alluvial lands inside the levee in one continuous map north to south from Tunica to Issaquena County.  This type of TSS also works hand in hand with my SDJR projects by allowing me to collect  notes and data while  joining all four alluvial map units together and put in place holders of known soil components based on previous mapping experience and data in Tunica County (updated map, 2006).  
To design the MLRA MU for Alluvial land, frequently flooded, for SDJR, I will need concurrence of the SSSs for which major soil series to use to cover the broad range of soil types lumped into one area.  Also, decide if it should be called an association, rather than miscellaneous land area.  Use Tunica County, MS and Tensas Parish, LA soil survey reports and NASIS data as guides.

Future projects:
1) Through SDJR and TSS work, it has been found that some areas inside the Mississippi River levees have been mapped and assigned soil series while other areas are still mapped as miscellaneous ""Alluvial Land"".  There are no components to the Alluvial land data map unit in the database; there is no helpful soils data to query for enhancing ""batture land"" restoration.  However TSS field investigations show that components range from Crevasse (psamments) to Dowling (aquepts) to Sharkey (Aquerts).  Increasingly, with new NRCS and private agency initiatives, land within the river levees is being restored through WRP, WREP, and MRBI.  In order to plan and conduct ecological restoration, soils data is needed.  There are 5 counties with alluvial land map units that have meaningless data mapunits (AR017, MS011, MS027, MS055, MS151).  This amounts to 200,696 acres that could potentially be re-mapped with meaningful soil mapunits that have data behind them.  This will require field investigations, soil data collection in the form of transect and pedon descriptions and soil samples for lab analysis for pH and PSA.  It is unlikely that new series would be established; there are plenty of established series which to correlate these un-named soils.  This project would also include spatial line work creating polygons and database work creating unprotected map units/dmu's.  Future projects have been populated for Alluvial lands remap in these 5 counties, so that more meaningful soil associations can be used for land use planning and USDA programs.  Other river counties in the Lower Mississippi Valley have mapped the soils inside the MS River levees (Phillips, AR; Tunica, MS; Warren, MS; East Carroll, LA; Madison, LA; Tensas, LA; Concordia, LA.  They are mapped as broad associations, but the associations are indicative of landform and textural classes, such as Commerce and Bruin soils, or Crevasse and Robinsonville soils, or Sharkey-Newellton-Tunica association.  That can be done for these 5 counties using lidar data and ground truthing in a short remap project.

2r0gkAlluvial land, frequently flooded

MLRA131A - Southern Mississippi River Alluvium
Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in four counties in Mississippi and one county in Arkansas.  These counties are Chicot (AR017), Bolivar (MS011), Coahoma (MS027), Issaquena (MS055), and Washington (MS151). 

Historic Map Unit Concept:  This map unit is a miscellaneous land type. No official series were described.  It was originally mapped as unclassified alluvial soils.  It lies between the Mississippi River and its levees.  It consists of mainly nearly level, poorly drained to excessively drained soils that are forested and frequently flooded.  The dominant soils are of the Commerce, Crevasse, Robinsonville, Newellton, Sharkey and Tunica series.  The soils, however, were mapped together and are shown on the detailed map as one unit  Alluvial land.  

The texture of the surface soils ranges from loamy sand to clay.  Though the soils are mostly nearly level (0 to 3 percent slopes), there are more strongly sloping areas along stream escarpments.  Overflows from the Mississippi River frequently cover the soils for long periods in spring and early summer.  

More than 90% of this area remains wooded, mainly with oak, gum, cottonwood, cypress, pecan, and willow.  The few cleared areas are used for corn, cotton, soybeans, and pasture.  

SDJR Map Unit Concept:  With State Soil Scientists agreement, for NRCS WRP and other program purposes, four main series and one miscellaneous area were selected to be representative components of this map unit.  Alluvial Land, frequently flooded is the map unit and it is being designated as an association.

56 to 213 cm (22 to 84 in); grayish brown loamy sand; moderately alkaline
Major land uses: Forestland and wildlife habitat
Pastureland
 Forage production can be improved by seeding grass-legume mixtures that are tolerant of flooding.
 Flooding can leave sediment on forage plants, thereby reducing the palatability of the plants and the forage intake by grazing animals.
Forestland
 Because of the low strength of the soils, ruts may form, resulting in unsafe conditions and damage to equipment.
 The flooding can damage haul roads, increase maintenance costs, and restrict the safe use of roads by logging trucks.
 The sandiness of the soils may reduce the traction of wheeled harvesting equipment and logging trucks and increase the maintenance of haul roads and log landings.
 The sandy layers can slough, thereby reducing the efficiency of mechanical planting equipment.
 Uncontrolled burning can destroy organic matter.
Building sites
 The frequent flooding greatly increases the risk of damage associated with floodwater. Because of the flooding, these soils are generally unsuited to building site development.
 Because of the high content of sand or gravel in the soils, the resistance to sloughing is reduced in shallow excavations and cutbanks are susceptible to caving.
Septic tank absorption fields
 These soils are generally unsuitable as a site for septic tank absorption fields. The flooding greatly limits the absorption and proper treatment of effluent from septic Careful selection and application of chemicals and fertilizers can minimize contamination of ground water.
 Compaction can be minimized by controlling traffic.
 Maintaining or increasing the content of organic matter in the soil helps to prevent crusting, improves tilth, and increases the rate of water infiltration.
Pastureland
 Excess water should be removed, or species of grasses or legumes that are adapted to wet soil conditions should be grown.
 Compaction can be minimized by restricting grazing during wet periods.
Forestland
 Because of the low strength of the soil, ruts may form, resulting in unsafe conditions and damage to equipment.
Building sites
 The seasonal high water table can restrict the period when excavations can be made. A higher than normal degree of construction site development and building maintenance may be needed.
 This soil is poorly suited to building site development. Structures may need special design to avoid damage from wetness.
 Shrinking and swelling of the soil can crack foundations and basement walls. Foundations and other structures may require special design and construction techniques or extra maintenance.
Septic tank absorption fields
 The restricted permeability and the seasonal high water table greatly limit the absorption and proper treatment of effluent from septic systems. Costly measures may be needed to lower the water table in the absorption field.
Local roads and streets
 Because of shrinking and swelling, this soil may not be suitable as base material for local roads and streets.

 Flooding can leave sediment on forage plants, thereby reducing the palatability of the plants and the forage intake by grazing animals.
 Excess water should be removed, or species of grasses or legumes that are adapted to wet soil conditions should be grown.
 Compaction can be minimized by restricting grazing during wet periods.
Forestland
 The seasonal high water table can restrict root respiration, thereby inhibiting the growth of some species of seedlings.
 Because of the low strength of the soils, ruts may form, resulting in unsafe conditions and damage to equipment.
 The flooding can damage haul roads, increase maintenance costs, and restrict the safe use of roads by logging trucks.
 Wetness in the soils can limit the use logging trucks.
 Because of the content of clay, these soils become sticky when wet. The stickiness increases the cost of constructing haul roads and log landings, reduces the efficiency of mechanical planting equipment, and restricts the use of equipment for site preparation to the drier periods.
Building sites
 The frequent flooding greatly increases the risk of damage associated with floodwater. Because of the flooding, these soils are generally unsuited to building site development.
 In some areas, the high content of clay in the subsoil increases the difficulty of digging, filling, and compacting the soil material in shallow excavations.
Septic tank absorption fields
 Because of the flooding and the seasonal high water table, these soils are generally unsuitable as a site for septic tank absorption fields.
 The flooding greatly limits the absorption and proper treatment of effluent from septic systems. Rapidly moving floodwater can damage some components of septic systems.
Local roads and streets
 Because of shrinking and swelling, these soils may not be suitable as base material for local roads and streets.
 The seasonal high water table affects the ease of excavation and grading and limits the load-bearing capacity of the soils.
 Roads and bridges need special design to avoid the damage caused by flooding.

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Commerce: 	20 percent
Sharkey: 	20 percent
Newellton: 	20 percent
Crevasse	:	20 percent
Riverwash:	20 percent

The mapunit composition was determined from mapunit descriptions in the published manuscripts and NASIS data. The SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from 6 mapunits to 1 mapunit and data mapunit. 

This mapunit is supported  by 18 pedon descriptions, but 0 lab pedons from the KSSL for the major components.  

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Crevasse has been submitted with edits for updates   in this SDJR project.  All typifying pedons meet the taxonomic classification.  Future projects have been populated for Alluvial lands remap in these 5 counties, so that more meaningful soil associations can be used for land use planning and USDA programs.  Other river counties in the Lower Mississippi Valley have mapped the soils inside the MS River levees (Phillips, AR; Tunica, MS; Warren, MS; East Carroll, LA; Madison, LA; Tensas, LA; Concordia, LA.  They are mapped as broad associations, but the associations are indicative of landform and textural classes, such as Commerce and Bruin soils, or Crevasse and Robinsonville soils, or Sharkey-Newellton-Tunica association.  That can be done for these 5 counties using lidar data and ground truthing in a short remap project.

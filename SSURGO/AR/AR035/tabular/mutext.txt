Mapunit Name - Commerce silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 131A:  Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in three counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Crittenden (AR035), Mississippi (AR093), and Phillips (AR107)). The series was established in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana in 1948. The OSD Type Location is in Tensas Parish, Louisiana. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1245 to 1321 mm (49 to 52 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 9.4 to 22.2 degrees C (49 to 72 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 230 to 295 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
Commerce soils are on the lower part of convex natural levee positions on the alluvial plain of the Mississippi River and its distributaries. Slope gradients are mainly less than 1 percent. Most areas are protected from flooding by man-made levees.

Minor Components:  
The minor component 'Aquepts' are slighlty lower than Commerce soils, occuring on nearly level to slightly depressed areas on flood plains. The 'Aquepts' component was built using the concept of the Mhoon series (Order: Inceptisols; Suborder: Aquepts). Field work is needed to determine a better composition of minor components for this map unit.

Parent Material:
Alluvium

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This soil is suitable for crop production. The predominant crops grown on this soil are cotton, corn, grain sorghum, alfalfa, wheat and truck crops such as okra, geen beans and tomatoes. Pasture grasses grown include common and improved bermudagrasses and tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Commerce: 90 percent
Aquepts: 10 percent 
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. Aquepts as a minor component replaces Mhoon and Aquents as a minor component. This is due to updates to taxonomy since this survey was originally published. Field work is needed to determine which minor components are the best fit for this map unit. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from three to one.
This mapunit is supported by six pedon descriptions. These six pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the six counties where this mapunit is correlated (some of these pedon descriptions are duplicates). 

Classification:
Commerce classification: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Commerce soils in this mapunit consist of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from the Mississippi River and its distributaries. The soil is saturated in layers below 1.5 to 4 feet during December to April in normal years. Commerce soils are somewhat poorly drained; runoff is low in slopes less than 1 percent.

Reaction: Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the surface. The upper part of the subsoil ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. The lower part of the subsoil is moderately alkaline. 

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Commerce was reviewed for SDJR. 

Spatial Data Quality:
Joins between Arkansas counties where this map unit does not exist should be investigated. Joins should also be investigated between Arkansas and Missouri.

MLRA 131A - Mississippi Valley Alluvium

Geographic Extent: The Dubbs series consists of very deep, well drained soils that have moderately permeablity. These soils are on nearly level to sloping natural levees or low terraces of the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium Major Land Resource Area. The series is of large extent.

Mapunit Composition and Reliability: 91% Dubbs, 5% Amagon, 4% Aquents (RVs)

Minor Components:

Amagon - slightly lower positions, poorly drained 
Aquents - low, drainageway positions with recent alluvium, poorly drained 

Dubbs Soil Description:
Typically, the surface layer is brown silt loam about 13 cm thick (5 inches). The subsurface is brown silt loam to a depth of about 30 cm (12 inches). The upper part of the subsoil layer is brown silty clay loam to a depth of about 86 cm (34 inches). The middle part is brown clay loam to a depth of about 127 cm (50 inches). The lower part is dark yellowish-brown loam to a depth of about 152 cm (60 inches). The substratum is brown fine sandy loam that extends to a depth of 183 cm (72 inches) or more.

Minor Components: 
Aquents: small narrow drainageways on terrace treads
Amagon: low concave depressions on terrace treads 


Parent Material: loamy alluvium


Typical Vegetation or Crops: row crops - Corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, and wheat. Pasture/hayland crops - tall fescue, improved bermudagrass
 

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Dundee   89%
Amagon    6%
Aquents   5%
 

Classification: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Endoaqualfs 


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations: Typically the surface is Dark grayish brown, friable silt loam; the subsurface is grayish brown friable silt loam; the upper part of the subsoil is grayish brown friable silt loam, the lower subsoil is firm, grayish brown silty clay loam; the lower solum and parent material is friable light grayish brown silt loam. 


Reaction: Surface layer - Extremely acid to moderately except where limed; Subsurface and subsoil layers - very strongly acid to moderately acid; parent material (below solum) very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR: Aquents component does not occur in all mapunit represented in this project. However, most of these mapunits are on very large terrace treads that do have small narrow drainageways that have narrow flood plains, and Amagon would be similar to most aqualf components, thus aquents was chosen to be an RV component.


Spatial Data Quality: Numerous county line joins need to be investigated. Many misjoins are simply slope related.

Use and Management
Major land uses: Cropland and homesites 
Cropland
All areas of this soil are prime farmland.
Careful selection and application of chemicals and fertilizers can minimize
contamination of ground water.
Clods can form if the soil is tilled when wet.
Compaction can be minimized by controlling traffic.
The rooting depth is restricted by the very high content of clay.
Maintaining or increasing the content of organic matter in the soil helps to prevent
crusting, improves tilth, and increases the rate of water infiltration.
A subsurface drainage system can help to lower the seasonal high water table. The
movement of water into the subsurface drains, however, is restricted. Drainage
guides can be used to determine the spacing requirements for tile.
Including deep-rooted cover crops in the rotation improves soil structure and
provides pathways in the clayey subsoil, thereby facilitating the movement of water
into subsurface drains.
Pastureland
 Excess water should be removed, or species of grasses or legumes that are
adapted to wet soil conditions should be grown.
Compaction can be minimized by restricting grazing during wet periods.
Forestland
The seasonal high water table can restrict root respiration, thereby inhibiting the
growth of some species of seedlings.
Because of the low strength of the soil, ruts may form, resulting in unsafe conditions
and damage to equipment.
Wetness in the soil can limit the use of logging trucks.
Because of the content of clay, this soil becomes sticky when wet. The stickiness
increases the cost of constructing haul roads and log landings, reduces the
efficiency of mechanical planting equipment, and restricts the use of equipment for
site preparation to the drier periods.
Building sites
In some areas, the high content of clay in the subsoil increases the difficulty of
digging, filling, and compacting the soil material in shallow excavations.
Septic tank absorption fields
 Because of the seasonal high water table, this soil is generally unsuitable as a site
for septic tank absorption fields.
Local roads and streets
 Because of shrinking and swelling, this soil may not be suitable as base material for
local roads and streets.
The seasonal high water table affects the ease of excavation and grading and limits
the load-bearing capacity of the soil.

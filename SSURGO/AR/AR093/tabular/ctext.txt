Sk  Sharkey clay, occasionally flooded.  This is a level, poorly drained soil in broad flat areas of the alluvial plain.  This soil is subject to occasional flooding.  The areas range from 25 to more than 5,000 acres.  Slope is less than 1 percent.
	Typically, the surface layer is dark gray, slightly acid clay about 9 inches thick.  The subsoil is dark gray clay, mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline clay to a depth of about 60 inches. In places the upper part of the subsoil is strongly acid.
	Included in mapping are a few small areas of Alligator, Commerce, Fausse, and Tunica soils.  The Alligator, Commerce, and Tunica soils are in slightly higher positions than Sharkey soil.  The Alligator soils are more acid in the subsoil.  The somewhat poorly drained Commerce soils are loamy throughout, and the Tunica are loamy in the lower part of the subsoil. Fausse soils are in depressional areas or swales and are very poorly drained.  Also included are a few small areas of Sharkey soils that have slopes of 1 to 3 percent and Sharkey soils that are subject to frequent flooding.  The included soils make up about 10 percent of the map unit.  
	This Sharkey soil has high fertility.  Water and air move through this soil very slowly.  Water runs off the surface very slowly and ponds in low places for long periods after heavy rains.  A seasonal high water table fluctuates between a depth of about 2 feet and the soil surface during December through April.  This soil has very high shrink-swell potential.  Adequate water is available to plants in most years.  This soil is subject to prolonged periods of flooding.  Flooding occurs about 3 time during each 15 year period during the crop growing season and more often during other times of the year.  Flood waters typically are 2 to 5 feet deep, and the depth exceeds 8 feet in places.  Flood durations can exceed 30 days.  The surface layer remains wet for long periods after heavy rains.  This soil has very high shrink-swell potential.  
	This soil is mostly used for cultivated crops, mainly soybeans.  Other crops are rice, grain sorghum, and wheat.  In some areas, this soil is used as woodland and wildlife habitat.  
	This soil is somewhat poorly suited to most cultivated crops.  Wetness and poor tilth are the main limitations.  Flooding is a hazard.  Short season crops can be grown in most years; however flooding can delay planting dates.  This soil is difficult to keep in good tilth, and it can be worked only within a narrow range of moisture content.  It becomes cloddy if tilled when too wet or too dry.  Flooding can be controlled by levees, channels, and pumps.  Proper row arrangement, field ditches, and vegetated outlets are needed to remove excess surface water.  Minimum tillage and returning all crop residue to the soil or regularly adding other organic matter improve fertility and tilth and help to maintain content of organic matter.  
	This soils is well suited to southern hardwoods.  The production potential is high.  The main concerns in producing and harvesting timber are the severe equipments use limitations and seedling mortality because of wetness and flooding.  Conventional methods of harvesting generally can be used, but their use may be limited during rainy periods, generally from December to June.  Trees suitable for planting are eastern cottonwood and American sycamore.
	This soil is somewhat poorly suited to pasture.  The main limitations are wetness and very slow permeability.  Flooding is a hazard.  The main suitable pasture plant is common bermudagrass.  Wetness limits the choice of plants and the period of grazing.  Shallow ditches can remove excess surface water.  Proper stocking, pasture rotation, and restricted grazing during wet periods help keep the pasture and soil in good condition.  Nitrogen fertilizer is needed for optimum forage productions.  Lime is generally not needed.	
	This soil is well suited to use as habitat for woodland and wetland wildlife.  Propagations of oaks and other mast-producing trees improves the habitat for squirrels, white-tailed deer, and many species of non-game birds.  Habitat for wetland wildlife can be improved by constructing shallow ponds to provide open water areas for waterfowl and furbearers.  
	This soil is poorly suited to most urban uses.  It is not suitable for building sites.  The main limitations are wetness, very high shrink-swell, and very slow permeability. Flooding is a hazard.  Major flood control structures and extensive local drainage systems are needed to protect this soil from flooding.  Designs for roads should offset the limitation of the soil to support a load.  The effects of shrinking and swelling can be minimized by proper design and by backfilling with materials that has low shrink-swell potential.  Septic tank absorption fields do not function properly during rainy periods because of wetness and very slow permeability.  Sewage lagoons are needed if this soil is used as homesites.  Lagoon levees should be of sufficient height to prevent floodwater from entering the lagoon.  
	This Sharkey soil is in capability subclass 4w and woodland group 2w.

Sk  Sharkey clay, occasionally flooded.  This level, poorly drained soil is in low positions on natural levees of the Black and Tensas Rivers and other former channels and distributaries of the Mississippi River.  The mapped areas are irregular in shape and range from 100 to 2,000 acres.  Slope is dominantly less than 1 percent.
	Typically, the surface layer is dark grayish brown, medium acid clay about 4 inches thick.  The subsoil is gray, mottled clay.  It is medium acid in the upper part and neutral in the lower part.  The underlying material to a depth of about 60 inches is gray, mottled, mildly alkaline clay.
	Included with this soil in mapping are a few small areas of Dundee, Fausse, and Tensas soils.  Dundee soils are in higher positions than Sharkey soil and are loamy throughout.  Fausse soils are in lower positions than Sharkey soil and are wet most of the time.  Tensas soils are in slightly higher positions than Sharkey soil and are loamy in the lower part of the subsoil.  Also included are a few small areas of soils that are similar to Sharkey soil except that they are underlain by reddish clay between a depth of 36 and 60 inches.  Included in places are Sharkey soils that are subject to frequent or rare flooding.  The included soils make up about 20 percent of the map unit.  
	Water and air move through this Sharkey soil very slowly.  Water runs off the surface very slowly and ponds in low places for long periods after heavy rains.  This soil has high fertility.  A seasonal high water table fluctuates between a depth of about 2 feet and the soil surface during December through April.  This soil has very high shrink-swell potential.  Adequate water is available to plants in most years.  This soil is subject to prolonged periods of flooding.  Flooding occurs less often than 2 years out of 5 on a yearly basis.  Flood waters typically are 2 to 5 feet deep, and the depth exceeds 10 feet in places.  Flood durations can exceed 60 days.
	Most of the acreage of this soil is used for cultivated crops.  A small acreage is in woodland and pastureland.  
	This soil is somewhat poorly suited to cultivated crops.  It is limited mainly by flooding, wetness, and poor tilth.  Suitable crops are soybeans and grain sorghums.  This soil is sticky when wet and hard when dry, and it becomes cloddy if tilled when too wet or too dry.  Flooding can be controlled by levees, channels, and pumps.  Proper row arrangement, field ditches, and vegetated outlets are needed to remove excess surface water.  Minimum tillage and returning all crop residue to the soil or regularly adding other organic matter improve fertility and tilth and help to maintain content of organic matter.  In flood years, water generally recedes in time to plant a short-season crop.  Reduced crop production as a result of late planting is common.
	This soil is somewhat poorly suited to pasture.  The main limitations are wetness and the hazard of occasional flooding.  The main suitable pasture plant is common bermudagrass.  Suitable grazing periods are limited by wetness and flooding.  During flood periods, cattle need to be moved to adjacent protected areas or to pastures at higher elevations.
	This soil is moderately well suited to woodland.  It has high potential for the production of green ash, overcup oak, water hickory, and sugarberry.  The main concerns in producing and harvesting timber are the severe equipments use limitations and seedling mortality because of wetness and flooding.  Conventional methods of harvesting generally can be used, but their use may be limited during rainy periods, generally from December to April.
	This soil is not suited to homesites, and it is poorly suited to urban and recreational development.  It is limited mainly by flooding, wetness, very high shrink-swell, very slow permeability, and low strength for roads.  Drainage and protection from flooding are needed to make this soil suitable for most urban uses.  
	This Sharkey soil is in capability subclass 4w and woodland group 2w.

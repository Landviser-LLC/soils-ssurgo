The originally entry had sand, silt, and clay percentages for a sandy clay loam, which does not match the description in the manuscript and does not fit the range in characteristics of the OSD.  There are two horizons included in this layer:  FSL 22 Cm thick, and L 49 Cm thick. Since Loam is in the middle of the allowed range of textures for the 2C and because it was the thickest of the two layers, it was chosen, and adjusted to fit a representative Loam texture.

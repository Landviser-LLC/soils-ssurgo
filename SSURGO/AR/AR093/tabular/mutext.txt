Mapunit Name - Alligator clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes, rarely flooded, brief duration, west

MLRA131A  Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in four counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Cross (AR037), Lee (AR077), Mississippi (AR093) and Poinsett (AR111). The OSD is located in LeFlore County, MS. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1219 to 1321 mm (48 to 52 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 10 to 21.6 degrees C (50 to 71 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 225 to 290 days
Soil Moisture Class: Udic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
The Alligator soils are in backswamps and on broad flats of the alluvial plains of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. They have a dark grayish brown clay surface layer and a subsoil of light brownish gray to grayish brown clay.

Minor Components:  
The Earle soils are in slightly higher positions, often separating broad flats (or, slack-water areas) from the natural levee and are typically underlain by coarser textured sediments.

The Sharkey soils occupy slightly lower positions in backswamps and on broad flats than the Alligator soils but have a higher pH.

The Tunica soils are in slightly higher positions, often separating broad flats (or, slack-water areas) from the natural levee and are typically underlain by coarser textured sediments.

*Earle soils are more commonly associated with Alligator soils and Tunica soils are more commonly associated with Sharkey soils due to their respective pH levels.

Parent Material:
Clayey alluvium deposited by flooding of the Mississippi River and its tributaries

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This mapunit is used for crop production and pastureland. The typical row crops grown are soybeans and cotton. Other suitable crops include grain sorghum, rice and wheat. Typical pasture grasses grown are Bermuda-grass and tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Alligator: 90 percent
Earle: 5 percent 
Sharkey: 3 percent
Tunica: 2 percent
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. The minor components were altered slightly to more accurately reflect soils on the natural landscape by replacing Aquents with named components commonly associated with Alligator soils. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from four to one.
This mapunit is supported by six pedon descriptions (two of these six pedon descriptions are duplicates). These six pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the four counties where this mapunit is correlated. 

Classification:
Alligator classification: Very-fine, smectitic, thermic Chromic Dystraquerts
The Alligator series was established in 1950 in Quitman County, Mississippi.

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Alligator soils in this mapunit are deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in clayey alluvium of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. They have a high shrink-swell potential and, when dry, have deep wide cracks in the upper part of the soil. Intersecting slickensides are within a depth of 40 inches. This soil is saturated in the surface layer and along cracks and slickenside faces in the subsoil from December through April in normal years.

Reaction: Reaction ranges from strongly acid to very strongly acid in the surface and the upper part of the B horizon. While the lower part of the B horizon commonly ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid, it can range as low as moderately alkaline. Where a C horizon is present, it ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. 

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Alligator was reviewed and updated for SDJR. 

Field work will be required throughout this mapunits distribution to collect pedon descriptions and transects for pedon documentation and minor component percentages as well as sampling to aide in updating classification. There are many minor components listed in the old survey manuscripts (and simply as Aquents in NASIS). The minor components which are listed for multiple counties have been designated as minor components for the MLRA Map Unit. Field work is needed to determine the percentage of these minor components as part of this map unit. The survey manuscripts used to compile the map units that are part of this project are very old (ranging from 1968 to 1977). At that time Alligator was classified as a Vertic Haplaquept. It is now recognized as a Chromic Dystraquert and as such warrants updated pedons (with horizonation assigned from current soil taxonomy).
Many of the Alligator map units that exist have pH RV's in the upper part of the soil that hover around 5.0 (in 1:1 water; a taxonomic requirement for Dystraquerts). Some are above 5.0. Little data exists about the EC of these soils. A study could be conducted to test the EC and pH of the soils of these map units, potentially classifying them as Epiaquerts or Endoaquerts rather than Dystraquerts.


Spatial Data Quality:
Where Poinsett, Cross and Mississippi Counties join Crittenden County, and where Cross and Lee Counties join St. Francis County, joins warrant more detailed examination as many of the map units stop 'cold' at county lines. 

This map unit warrants review of flooding phases as it is mapped in both the protected and unprotected sides of the St. Francis River levee system. It is believed that mapping was done prior to installation of the levee system.

Mapunit Name - Commerce silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 131A:  Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent:
This mapunit is correlated in three counties in Arkansas.  These counties are Crittenden (AR035), Mississippi (AR093), and Phillips (AR107)). The series was established in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana in 1948. The OSD Type Location is in Tensas Parish, Louisiana. 

Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1245 to 1321 mm (49 to 52 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 9.4 to 22.2 degrees C (49 to 72 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 230 to 295 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: 
Commerce soils are on the lower part of convex natural levee positions on the alluvial plain of the Mississippi River and its distributaries. Slope gradients are mainly less than 1 percent. Most areas are protected from flooding by man-made levees.

Minor Components:  
The minor component 'Aquepts' are slighlty lower than Commerce soils, occuring on nearly level to slightly depressed areas on flood plains. The 'Aquepts' component was built using the concept of the Mhoon series (Order: Inceptisols; Suborder: Aquepts). Field work is needed to determine a better composition of minor components for this map unit.

Parent Material:
Alluvium

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This soil is suitable for crop production. The predominant crops grown on this soil are cotton, corn, grain sorghum, alfalfa, wheat and truck crops such as okra, geen beans and tomatoes. Pasture grasses grown include common and improved bermudagrasses and tall fescue. 
Presently, there are no ecological sites developed or assigned to the components of this mapunit.   

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Commerce: 90 percent
Aquepts: 10 percent 
The mapunit composition was determined from the compositions around which this SDJR project was centered. Aquepts as a minor component replaces Mhoon and Aquents as a minor component. This is due to updates to taxonomy since this survey was originally published. Field work is needed to determine which minor components are the best fit for this map unit. This SDJR project reduced the number of mapunits and data mapunits from three to one.
This mapunit is supported by six pedon descriptions. These six pedon descriptions are the Taxonomic Unit Descriptions from the six counties where this mapunit is correlated (some of these pedon descriptions are duplicates). 

Classification:
Commerce classification: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Commerce soils in this mapunit consist of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from the Mississippi River and its distributaries. The soil is saturated in layers below 1.5 to 4 feet during December to April in normal years. Commerce soils are somewhat poorly drained; runoff is low in slopes less than 1 percent.

Reaction: Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the surface. The upper part of the subsoil ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. The lower part of the subsoil is moderately alkaline. 

Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
The official series description for Commerce was reviewed for SDJR. 

Spatial Data Quality:
Joins between Arkansas counties where this map unit does not exist should be investigated. Joins should also be investigated between Arkansas and Missouri.

Mapunit Name - Dundee silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 131A - Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium

Geographic Extent: These mapping units are level to gently sloping natural levees and low terraces along former channels of the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium Major Land Resource Area; MLRA 131


Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 894 to 1545 mm (35 to 61 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 8.8 to 21.6 degrees C (48 to 71 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 195 to 269 days
Soil Moisture Class: aquic

Geographic Setting: 
Major Component: level to gently sloping soils on natural levees and low terraces along former channels of the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium Major Land Resource Area


Minor Components: 
Aquents: small narrow drainageways on terrace treads
Amagon: low concave depressions on terrace treads 


Parent Material: loamy alluvium


Typical Vegetation or Crops: row crops - Corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, and wheat. Pasture/hayland crops - tall fescue, improved bermudagrass
 

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
Dundee   89%
Amagon    6%
Aquents   5%
 

Classification: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Endoaqualfs 


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations: Typically the surface is Dark grayish brown, friable silt loam; the subsurface is grayish brown friable silt loam; the upper part of the subsoil is grayish brown friable silt loam, the lower subsoil is firm, grayish brown silty clay loam; the lower solum and parent material is friable light grayish brown silt loam. 


Reaction: Surface layer - Extremely acid to moderately except where limed; Subsurface and subsoil layers - very strongly acid to moderately acid; parent material (below solum) very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR: Aquents component does not occur in all mapunit represented in this project. However, most of these mapunits are on very large terrace treads that do have small narrow drainageways that have narrow flood plains, and Amagon would be similar to most aqualf components, thus aquents was chosen to be an RV component.


Spatial Data Quality: Numerous county line joins need to be investigated. Many misjoins are simply slope related.

52 to 76 inches; gray clay; neutral 
Use and Management
Major land uses: Cropland and homesites 
Cropland
All areas of this soil are prime farmland.
Careful selection and application of chemicals and fertilizers can minimize
contamination of ground water.
Clods can form if the soil is tilled when wet.
Compaction can be minimized by controlling traffic.
The rooting depth is restricted by the very high content of clay.
Maintaining or increasing the content of organic matter in the soil helps to prevent
crusting, improves tilth, and increases the rate of water infiltration.
A subsurface drainage system can help to lower the seasonal high water table. The
movement of water into the subsurface drains, however, is restricted. Drainage
guides can be used to determine the spacing requirements for tile.
Including deep-rooted cover crops in the rotation improves soil structure and
provides pathways in the clayey subsoil, thereby facilitating the movement of water
into subsurface drains.
Pastureland
 Excess water should be removed, or species of grasses or legumes that are
adapted to wet soil conditions should be grown.
Compaction can be minimized by restricting grazing during wet periods.
Forestland
The seasonal high water table can restrict root respiration, thereby inhibiting the
growth of some species of seedlings.
Because of the low strength of the soil, ruts may form, resulting in unsafe conditions
and damage to equipment.
Wetness in the soil can limit the use of logging trucks.
Because of the content of clay, this soil becomes sticky when wet. The stickiness
increases the cost of constructing haul roads and log landings, reduces the
efficiency of mechanical planting equipment, and restricts the use of equipment for
site preparation to the drier periods.
Building sites
In some areas, the high content of clay in the subsoil increases the difficulty of
digging, filling, and compacting the soil material in shallow excavations.
Septic tank absorption fields
 Because of the seasonal high water table, this soil is generally unsuitable as a site
for septic tank absorption fields.
Local roads and streets
 Because of shrinking and swelling, this soil may not be suitable as base material for
local roads and streets.
The seasonal high water table affects the ease of excavation and grading and limits
the load-bearing capacity of the soil.

guides can be used to determine the spacing requirements for tile.
Including deep-rooted cover crops in the rotation improves soil structure and
provides pathways in the clayey subsoil, thereby facilitating the movement of water
into subsurface drains.
Pastureland
 Excess water should be removed, or species of grasses or legumes that are
adapted to wet soil conditions should be grown.
Compaction can be minimized by restricting grazing during wet periods.
Forestland
The seasonal high water table can restrict root respiration, thereby inhibiting the
growth of some species of seedlings.
Because of the low strength of the soil, ruts may form, resulting in unsafe conditions
and damage to equipment.
Wetness in the soil can limit the use of logging trucks.
Because of the content of clay, this soil becomes sticky when wet. The stickiness
increases the cost of constructing haul roads and log landings, reduces the
efficiency of mechanical planting equipment, and restricts the use of equipment for
site preparation to the drier periods.
Building sites
In some areas, the high content of clay in the subsoil increases the difficulty of
digging, filling, and compacting the soil material in shallow excavations.
Septic tank absorption fields
 Because of the seasonal high water table, this soil is generally unsuitable as a site
for septic tank absorption fields.
Local roads and streets
 Because of shrinking and swelling, this soil may not be suitable as base material for
local roads and streets.
The seasonal high water table affects the ease of excavation and grading and limits
the load-bearing capacity of the soil.

Mapunit Name - Sharkey-Steele complex, 0 to 1 percent slopes

MLRA 131A - Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent:
Sharkey: formed in clayey alluvium, these soils are on flood plains and low terraces of the Mississippi River; MLRA 131A.  

Steele: formed in sandy and clayey river deposits, Steele soils are found on level to undulating areas of flood plains and commonly are in narrow bands paralleling overflow channels.  

Climate:

Mean annual air temperature:  to  degrees 10 C 21 (52 to 70 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 225 to 270 days
Soil Moisture Class: Sharkey: Aquic, Steele: Udic

Geographic Setting: Sharkey: flood plains and low terraces of Mississippi River  Steele: level to undulating areas of flood plains, commonly in narrow bands paralleling overflow channels

Major Component: 

Sharkey, Steele

Minor Components:  

Mhoon, Hayti

Parent Material: Sharkey: clayey alluvium, Steele: clayey alluvium with loamy to sandy overwash


Typical Vegetation or Crops: row crops such as cotton, soybeans, and wheat.  Also, some pasture and hayland (bermuda grass, fescue). 
 

Mapunit Composition and Reliability:
 
Sharkey: 60% 
Steele: 30%
Mhoon: 5%
Hayti: 5%

Classification: 

Sharkey: Very fine, smetitic, thermic, Chromic Epiaquerts
Steele: Sandy over clayey, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermis Aquic Udifluvents


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations: (Sharkey) The construction of levees along the Mississippi River and its tributaries along with the installation of an intricate network of regional, local and field drains to remove surface water has altered the hydrology of Sharkey and other soils in the valley. These soils are now saturated only in the upper part of the surface layer, and along cracks and slickenside faces in the subsoil from December through April in normal years. The soils are reduced in the upper part of the surface horizon and have positive reaction to alpha,alpha-dipyridyl solution during periods when water is on the surface. The surface is very dark grayish brown clay, 7 inches deep; the upper subsoil is dark gray clay; the lower subsoil is dark gray 26 inches or more thick. (Steele) The surface is grayish brown loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand (overwash) 6 to 10 inches thick; the subsurface is pale brown, loamy fine sand about 2 inches thick; the upper subsoil is grayish brown, loamy fine sand 20 inches thick; the lower subsoil (discontinuity) is gray clay, more than 46 inches thick. 
 



Reaction: Sharkey: medium acid to neutral, Steele: strongly acid to neutral


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR: Steele soils are essentially deep overwashes of such soils as Hayti, Cooter, and Sharkey but cannot be considered as overwash phases since the thickness is more than 20 inches.

MLRA 131A - Southern Mississippi River Alluvium

Geographic Extent: 
These soils are on the flood plains of the Mississippi River and its tributaries of the Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium Major Land Resource Area. 


Climate:
Mean annual precipitation: 1194 to 1270 mm (47 to 53 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 10 to 22.8 degrees C (50 to 73 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 235 to 295 days
Soil Moisture Class: Aquic

Geographic Setting 
Major Component: Tunica


Minor Components:  Sharkey


Parent Material: 
Clayey alluvium over loamy alluvium


Typical Vegetation or Crops: 
Row crops such as cotton, wheat, and soybeans; pasture and hayland crops such as bermuda and fescue
 

Mapunit Composition and Reliability: 
Tunica silty clay: 93%
Sharkey silty clay: 7%  

Classification: CLAYEY OVER LOAMY, SMECTITIC OVER MIXED, SUPERACTIVE, NONACID, THERMIC VERTIC EPIAQUEPTS


Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations: 
Typically the surface is dark grayish brown silty clay 5 inches thick; the subsoil is dark gray silt clay to about 27 inches; the underlying material is variable in texture, largely loam or fine sandy loam, shades of brown and brownish gray.


Reaction:
Moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the upper part, moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part.


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
Material below the litologic discontinuity is HIGHLY variable and cannot be represented accurately in the sieve data in NASIS.  Ranging from Sand (and its subdivisions) to silty clay is too wide a range for the L-RV-H segregations


Spatial Data Quality: 
There is a two (possibly three) county gap in distribution of this map unit.  In Mississippi County, this unit joins Tunica clay map units in Poinsett County.  This has been addressed in future projects.

Use and Managment: 

Excess water and the clayey nature of this soil are the main limitations. Flooding and standing wa ter cannot be prevented by individual landowners.


Drainage ditches help to remove the excess water from most places, but some tracts on each side of the levee cannot be drained when the river is high, because outlets are not available. Smoothing and grading would eliminate low spots and further im prove surface drainage, but these measures general ly are not practical between the levee and the river, because the effects are destroyed by floods in a year or two.
Little of this soil is wooded, but cottonwood, sycamore, oak, and black willow would grow rapidly.
Areas that are not subject to severe flooding can be used part of the time as reservoirs for raising fish and part of the time as cropland. Fish require water 2 to 6 feet deep. Levees are needed for im pounding the water and for keeping floodwater out.
Then a system of drainage is needed before crops, such as soybeans and corn, can be planted. Johnson grass and other weeds that interfere with crops would be killed while the water is impounded. The leveed areas could also be managed to attract water fowl. (Capability unit IIw-4)

|"Miscellaneous notes"|"NONTECH - AGR"|"021"|"This soil is moderately suited to cultivated crops. Rice, soybeans, and grain sorghum are the main crops grown on this soil. Excess surface water is a severe hazard and surface drainage is needed in most areas. Because of high clay content, clods often form on the surface if the soil is plowed when wet. This soil is moderately suited to pasture and hayland. Wetness is the main restriction during the winter and early spring. Suitable pasture plants include bermudagrass and tall fescue."|"3272032"|"2416872"

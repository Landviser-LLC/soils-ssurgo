* More pedon data needs to be collected for complete aggregation of all map units.

* Geology breaks need to be made.
* Base saturation studies need to be made as related to geology and map units.
* Map units need finer slope breaks.

* Flooding needs to be addressed and water table studies conducted.
* All large scarp slopes on terraces need to have a line feature added or a polygon feature added if large enough.
* Leveled lands need to be investigated.
* Foot slope soil units along Crowleys Ridge need to be reevaluated.

7)  The Soil-Landscape Model.
* Amagon-Dundee-Crevasse:Poorly drained and somewhat poorly drained that are loamy throughout and excessively drained soils that are sand throughout
* Sharkey-Steele:Poorly drained soils that have a thick clayey subsoil and moderately well drained soils that are sandy in the upper part and clayey in the lower part.
* Sharkey-Crowley:Poorly drained soils that are clayey in some part of the subsoil
* Tunica-Bowdre-Sharkey:Moderately well drained and poorly drained soils that are clayey in some par of the subsoil
* Convent-Morganfield-Crevasse:Somewhat poorly drained to well drained soils that are loamy throughout and excessively drained soils that are sandy throughout
* Alligator-Earle:Poorly drained and somewhat poorly drained soils that have a dominantly clayey subsoil"|"15123"|"77053"
02/23/2009 00:00:00|"Miscellaneous notes"|"evaluation"|"spatial"|"4) GIS Evaluation of Line Placement.
* Water needs adjusting
* New water needs delineating
* Levees need delineating
* Crevassee seems out of place
* MMA boundary needs adjusting, the ridge is split and does not follow a physiographic landform
* Flooding is the same on both sides of levee


5) Field Verification.
* Most of the mapping appears fairly good.
* Slope breaks need refined.
* Series need to be confined geologically.
* Flood plains, stream terraces, toe slopes need the most work.

*Improve landscape delineation joins at county and state lines. 

*Different fine silty somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained soil series have been mapped in similar landscape positions over time in different soil survey areas.  These include Commerce, Hayti, Mhoon, and Jeanerette on flood plains and the Dundee, Askew Amagon, Routon and other series on terraces.  A study is needed to determine the actual composition of these map units and if soil characteristics and resulting interpretations are sufficiently different to justify several different series for similar soils.

*The extent and impact of land leveling and related alteration for water management and effects on soil properties and interpretations.  Can land-leveled areas be consistently identified and delineated, and can delineation be kept current?  Can leveled areas be described and characterized, and what is the degree of variability within delineations?  Will the delineations and interpretations provide information that is more useful than the original soil maps?  Will the variability within map units be so great that interpretations are useless?"|"15123"|"77055"
07/14/2009 00:00:00|"Miscellaneous notes"|"evaluation"|"attribute"|"EVALUATION SUMMARY: ITEMS NEEDING TO BE ADDRESSED (PROJECTS)
*All map units need transecting to determine composition, and physical property data and lab data is needed for all components, especially for benchmark soils.  Specific priority projects are addressed in the following summary. 

*Make flooding frequencies of map units uniform across county / state lines.  New map units may be needed for map units protected / not protected by levee.

*There is very little hydrology / seasonal ground water data for soil series in this survey area and other similar survey areas in this region.  This is one of the major variables in soil characteristics this area and one of the most important characteristics used to generate interpretations.  Data is needed for representative soil series.  Data is also needed for map units that represent different degrees of alteration of natural hydrology by practices including drainage ditches, levees and other alteration including land leveling.  Ground water data is also needed for the same map unit on the protected side of the levee compared to the river side of the levee (batture).

*A study is needed of soil color / morphology and related hydrology / drainage classes of clayey soils including Sharkey, Tunica and associated complexes.  Establish a landscape model for separating components with different hydrology within these map units, or if not separable, characterize composition of existing map unit.  LIDAR data would be useful in this project.

*A study is needed to address soil color / morphology and hydrology / drainage classes of non-clayey map units and establish a landscape model for separating components, or characterize map unit composition.  This project will be related to ongoing region-wide Dundee study.

*Accurately determine composition of multi-component map units based on current series concepts.  No transect data is available.  Multi component units do not join well with surrounding surveys.  The Routon-Dundee-Crevasse complex has a large extent and does not join well with surrounding areas.  The name of this unit appears to have been changed in correlation.

*Investigate extent and pattern of occurrence of Mollisols and mollic intergrades, and non-mollic dark surface horizons.  A regional study is needed to determine the extent and limits of these soils within MLRA 131 and to insure consistent mapping of these series across county and state lines.  Include investigation of whether clayey surface horizons meet structure, hardness and organic matter content required for mollic epipedon.

*Study of textural family classes of loamy soils on natural levees.  Several different series including Robinsonville, Morganfield, and Carruthersville have been mapped on the same landscape position in existing soil surveys within the region.  The study should also include non-well-drained series including Convent, Adler."|"15123"|"77056"

*Make interpretations more uniform across adjoining map units at county and state lines.  Review NASIS data and interpretation rationale and revise NASIS data to produce better matches of interpretations at county / state lines.  Focus on most frequently used interpretations, including hydric soil map units.  Review and determine which map units are considered to be acceptable joins.

*Review interpretation criteria for surface irrigation.  Most map units show as very limited.  This is currently one of the most rapidly increasing practices in the county.  Can an interpretation be made for potential for precision land leveling?"|"15123"|"77057"

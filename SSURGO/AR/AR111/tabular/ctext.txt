The natural drainage class is poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 12 inches during January, February, March, April. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 3w.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria.   "|"21857783"|"22173002"

The logic used to make this adjustment was as follows with a few exceptions.  Well drained and drier components with RV slopes containing a "".5"" were rounded up and Moderately Well Drained and wetter soils containing a "".5"" were rounded down.  "|"21857783"|"22173003"

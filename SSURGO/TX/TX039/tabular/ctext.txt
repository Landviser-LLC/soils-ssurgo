Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon.

Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
Tidal Flats are areas adjacent to the bay where marshes ebb and flow with water as a result of tide phases.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep and very poorly drained that formed in saline loamy alluvium or eolian coastal deposits. The soils have very slow permeability, strong salinity, and strong sodicity with a neutral through moderately alkaline soil reaction. Soils exhibit halic soil properties along with a peraquic moisture regime. An organic mat of decomposing plant material can be found 1 to 8 inches thick on the surface. Soils correlated to this site include: Follet, Karankawa, Rahal, Tatlum, and Tracosa.

Reference Community
Smooth cordgrass dominates this community. Smooth cordgrass is adapted to high salinity soils with tidal inundation, wave action, and occasional burial. Average depth of water at high tide ranges from 2 to 12 inches and salinity varies from 12 to 50 parts per thousand, though rainfall may lower salinity. Subdominant grass species include marshhay cordgrass and inland saltgrass (Distichlis spicata). Salt-tolerant forbs such as glassworts and saltworts (Salicornia spp and Batis spp.) may occupy interspaces between cordgrass bunches. This is a highly resilient community and well adapted to storm impacts. Typical recovery time from tropical storms and mild hurricanes is about a year. The site is relatively grazing tolerant due to the low palatability of mature cordgrass. Lack of grazing combined with high resiliency has resulted in many remnant reference sites. Burning is an option to remove rank vegetation, increase palatability, and diversity of plants.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
Blacklands consist of very deep, moderately well to well drained, very slowly permeable, slightly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Soils correlated to this site include: Banquete, Contee, Laewest, Marcado, and Victoria.

Reference Community
The Reference Plant Community for the Blackland is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Composition of tallgrasses make up over 60 percent of annual production, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and associated grasses, forbs, shrubs and woody vines make up the remainder. Historically, bison grazing was intermittent, and fires were both frequent (3 to 8 years) and intense. Annual forbs occur in greater or lesser amounts in response to grazing intensity, fire, drought, or excessive precipitation. This prairie site was heavily grazed by large numbers of domestic livestock by the late 1800's. Overgrazing without rest was exacerbated by the introduction of barbed wire fencing and water development. Overgrazing resulted in reduced production of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrass and some midgrass species and reduction of fire frequency and intensity. Some mid and shortgrasses increased because of this overgrazing and eventually annual forbs and grasses.

The depth of the surface horizon ranges from 6 to 19 inches, and the depth of the soils are greater than 80 inches. Surface runoff is negligible because of seepage from adjoining sites and the relative landscape position; a water table is present in this soil at a depth of 10 to 30 inches. Soils correlated to this site include: Lopeno, Mustang, and Potrero.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for the site is an open grassland plain composed of midgrasses. Widely varying amounts of gulfdune paspalum and marshhay cordgrass dominate the site. The prairie consists of midgrasses dominated by gulfdune paspalum, marshhay cordgrass, or any combination thereof. Seacoast bluestem occurs on moderately drained flats and swales while bushy bluestem occurs in poorly drained areas. American bulrush is also associated with these grass communities in poorly drained areas. Other important associated perennial and annual forbs include mistflower (Conoclinium coelestinum), sea lavender (Limonium carolinianum), bushy sea-ox-eye, and narrowleaf marshelder. Heavy grazing results in a change in the plant community composition by strongly reducing the occurrence of gulfdune paspalum and increasing the abundance of forbs.

Reference Community
The Tall/Midgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is the reference community. Seacoast bluestem (also known as shore little bluestem) dominates this site. Other important associated grasses include gulfdune paspalum and brownseed paspalum. It also supports a diverse understory community of perennial legumes and other forbs. Under heavy grazing and elimination of fire, the community will shift from an open tallgrass/midgrass prairie to a Midgrass Community (1.2). Like other prairie ecological sites, woody species are present, but only in sparse amounts. Occasional fires or hurricanes help manage the density of woody vegetation. Woody canopy cover exceeding 15 percent indicates a transition to the Shrubland State (2). The driving factor is the size of woody plants, which relates to reproductive capability. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State (2) are resprouting species, the transition starts to increase soon after fire or brush control ceases. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 15 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process. Managers need to monitor the increase in woody species and realize that when canopy approaches 15 percent a threshold is about to be crossed. There is a 3 to 5-year window of action before the rapid transition to the Shrubland State occurs.

Ecological Site Concept
 The central concept of this site is somewhat isolated from salt water intrusion. The salinity ranges are never high but there is some salinity in the soil that will manifest itself during periods of dry weather. The best indicator plant on this site is seashore Paspalum. Lesser amounts of California bulrush, Olney bulrush, softstem bulrush, marshhay cordgrass, spikesedges, seedbox, Colorado River hemp, and cattails are also found. Elevation, drainage, salinity, water depth, and duration play a major role in the vegetation. Small areas of open water are also included. These areas are important to waterfowl and other wildlife because habitat diversity. Water salinity level varies throughout the year.

Ecological Site Concept
Salt Prairies occur on the inland portion of the Coastal Plains with a mid/tallgrass component on slopes ranging from 0 to 5 percent.

Soil Features
Soils are very deep, very poorly to somewhat poorly drained with very slow to moderate permeability. This site is affected by its degree of salinity and sodicity, more than the influence of the surface texture. Other features include no to very few rock fragments, 0 to 5 percent gypsum, and neutral to strongly alkaline soil reaction. Soils correlated to this site include: Livco, Livia, Matagorda, Narta, Palacios, Porfirio, Sievers, Surfside, and Topo.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is an open grassland with gulf cordgrass, little bluestem, seacoast bluestem, switchgrass, Hartweg's paspalum, seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), marshhay cordgrass, and traces of bushy sea oxeye (Borrichia frutescens). Variations in salinity and soil moisture cause local variations in the plant community, particularly along streams. Studies have shown that length and amount of inundation, and fresh or saltwater runoff have a controlling influence on the post-inundation plant community. Heavy grazing pressure will quickly depress little/seacoast bluestem and lead to a dominance of gulf cordgrass. Inundation with salt water may also cause little/seacoast bluestem to disappear for 2 to 3 years post-inundation. A lengthy inundation with fresh or brackish water may cause the post-inundation community to be dominated by gulf cordgrass.

Ecological Site Concept
These areas are on low gulf coastal brackish marshes at elevations of 3 feet or less. Slopes range from 0.1 to 0.5 percent. The soils formed in unconsolidated fluid clayey coastal sediments or thin accumulations of herbaceous plant remains and semi-fluid clayey alluvium over consolidated clayey deposits or submerged soils formed in prairie aged loess-like deposits. The unconsolidated sediments are firm enough for cattle to graze. These areas flood frequently with fresh or brackish water during high tides and remain ponded for very long duration. Marshhay cordgrass and/or seashore saltgrass dominate this site. Saltmarsh bulrush and needlegrass rush are also found in smaller amounts. Elevation, drainage, and salinity play a major role in the kinds and amounts of secondary vegetation that occur on this site. Small areas of open water are also included. These areas are important to waterfowl and other wildlife because of habitat diversity. Surface water salinity levels vary during the year depending on rainfall and tides. This causes temporary shifts from intermediate marsh to brackish marsh vegetative types. Fresher water and slightly higher elevated parts of the site are indicated by the presence of common reed.

Soil Features
Soils on this site include Andry, Creole, Gentilly and saline phases of Fausse. The soils formed in unconsolidated fluid clayey coastal sediments or thin accumulations of herbaceous plant remains and semi-fluid clayey alluvium over consolidated clayey deposits or submerged soils formed in prairie aged loess-like deposits. The thickness of organic material ranges from 0 to 10 inches to the contact with fluid clays or silty clays. The herbaceous surface material is mainly hemic and sapric material, but fribric materials as woody peat or wood fragments occur as thin strata. The unconsolidated brackish mineral and organic sediments are soft on the surface but become firm at shallow enough depths to support cattle for grazing. The n-values are generally less than 0.7 at 10 to 40 inches below the surface, but range to 1.0. These soils flood frequently with fresh and brackish water during high tides.

Reference Community
The Brackish Firm Mineral Marsh ecological site can potentially support a somewhat diverse mixture of grasses, grass-like plants, and forbs. Marshhay cordgrass is the dominant species in this plant community and is the plant that management considerations are based on. Marshhay cordgrass is typically found where salinity levels are between 3 and 9 ppt and water depth is up to 6 inches. Secondary herbaceous vegetation is directly influenced by factors such as elevation, water depth, and salinity. Variations in one or more of these factors can result in the plant community shifting back and forth from species that are typically associated with more saline conditions to species that are generally associated with fresh marsh. Seashore paspalum, Olney bulrush (three-corner grass), saltmarsh bulrush (leafy three-square) and California bulrush (bullwhip) are the most significant sub-dominant species. Seashore saltgrass is usually found in the small drainageways within the site. It can withstand more saline conditions and longer periods of inundation than marshhay cordgrass. Low growing and sod-forming grasses and grass-like plants such as dwarf spikerush, and fragrant flatsedge are minor components of this plant community. Roseau cane (common reed) occurs in areas that are fresher or slightly elevated. The primary forbs found on this site are cattail, saltmarsh morningglory, and saltmarsh mallow. Widgeongrass is a submerged aquatic species that is typically found in open water areas within the brackish marsh and is an excellent duck food. Shrubs are rare to non-existent on this site in its pristine state, however a few widely scattered shrubs may occur. Those shrubby species may include bigleaf sumpweed (marsh elder), eastern baccharis, and wolfberry. Fire is a major mangaement tool for this plant community. Without fire the accumulated rough of marshhay cordgrass not only suppresses other vegetation, but it can also reduce its own annual production because the old growth suppresses the potential for new, vigorous growth. Prescribed fire allows species such as dwarf spikerush and seashore saltgrass to increase both spatially and in biomass production.

Ecological Site Concept
Tidal Flats are areas adjacent to the bay where marshes ebb and flow with water as a result of tide phases.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep and very poorly drained that formed in saline loamy alluvium or eolian coastal deposits. The soils have very slow permeability, strong salinity, and strong sodicity with a neutral through moderately alkaline soil reaction. Soils exhibit halic soil properties along with a peraquic moisture regime. An organic mat of decomposing plant material can be found 1 to 8 inches thick on the surface. Soils correlated to this site include: Follet, Karankawa, Rahal, Tatlum, and Tracosa.

Reference Community
Smooth cordgrass dominates this community. Smooth cordgrass is adapted to high salinity soils with tidal inundation, wave action, and occasional burial. Average depth of water at high tide ranges from 2 to 12 inches and salinity varies from 12 to 50 parts per thousand, though rainfall may lower salinity. Subdominant grass species include marshhay cordgrass and inland saltgrass (Distichlis spicata). Salt-tolerant forbs such as glassworts and saltworts (Salicornia spp and Batis spp.) may occupy interspaces between cordgrass bunches. This is a highly resilient community and well adapted to storm impacts. Typical recovery time from tropical storms and mild hurricanes is about a year. The site is relatively grazing tolerant due to the low palatability of mature cordgrass. Lack of grazing combined with high resiliency has resulted in many remnant reference sites. Burning is an option to remove rank vegetation, increase palatability, and diversity of plants.

Ecological Site Concept
Salt Marshes are closed depressions of the inland Coastal Plains exhibiting salt-tolerant vegetation.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, saline, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. Tidal influence and salty substrates produce saline to brackish conditions. However, at any given location, the degree of salinity is a result of the local interaction of tidal influence, freshwater inflows, and substrate salt content. This site has an Aquic soil moisture regime with gleyed colors throughout the profile. Other features include moderate to strong sodicity and neutral to strong alkalinity. Soil correlated to this site include: Harris, Placedo, Swan, and Velasco.

Reference Community
The reference community is a mixture of mid and tallgrasses making up greater than 80 percent of the biomass. Dominant grasses include marshhay cordgrass (Spartina patens), common reed (Phragmites australis), and seashore dropseed (Sporobolus virginicus). Interstitial graminoids include shoregrass (Monanthochloe littoralis), seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum), and bulrushes (Scirpus spp.). Forbs include dwarf glasswort (Salicornia virginica), sea lavender (Limonium carolinianum), and seacoast sumpweed (Iva annua). Shrubs and half-shrubs are generally sparse in this community, but if present may include sea oxeye (Borrichia frutescens) and wolfberry (Lycium carolinianum). Smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), and saltmarsh bulrush (Bolboschoenus robustus) occur on the more saline areas. Fresher parts of the site are indicated by the presence of Common reed, big cordgrass (Spartina cynosuroides), and seashore paspalum. Shifts in composition may occur due to changes in the water and/or salinity regimes or in response to grazing impacts. Any of these sets of factors may produce similar vegetation responses and thus careful assessment must be made to determine the cause of observed changes. Many of the graminoids become coarse and unpalatable at maturity and fire can be used to stimulate new, more palatable growth and increase production. Improper grazing can cause a decrease in cordgrass, seashore dropseed, and common reed. When they are grazed frequently, they will be eliminated from the site because their root system is unable to recover. When the desirable plants have decreased, less desirable plants such as inland saltgrass and smooth cordgrass start to increase. Cordgrasses and other plants within this community primary reproduce vegetatively by rhizomes, which makes this site very resilient to disturbance. However, once they are eliminated they are hard to reestablish. Reseeding is not an option for this site because most of the seeds from these species are sterile. To reestablish these species transplanting or bringing in rhizomes are possible options for reestablishment. Unwanted species are limited due to the high salinity in the soil. Plants that are intolerant of salt are controlled with a tidal surge or hurricanes.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei).

The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Bottomland site is very deep with clay surface textures occurring on flood plains. The areas can be flooded and ponded for lengthy durations throughout the year.

Soil Features
The soils are poorly drained to moderately well drained and very deep. Permeability is very slow. The surface texture is typically clay. Soil reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
Salt Marshes are closed depressions of the inland Coastal Plains exhibiting salt-tolerant vegetation.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, saline, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. Tidal influence and salty substrates produce saline to brackish conditions. However, at any given location, the degree of salinity is a result of the local interaction of tidal influence, freshwater inflows, and substrate salt content. This site has an Aquic soil moisture regime with gleyed colors throughout the profile. Other features include moderate to strong sodicity and neutral to strong alkalinity. Soil correlated to this site include: Harris, Placedo, Swan, and Velasco.

Reference Community
The reference community is a mixture of mid and tallgrasses making up greater than 80 percent of the biomass. Dominant grasses include marshhay cordgrass (Spartina patens), common reed (Phragmites australis), and seashore dropseed (Sporobolus virginicus). Interstitial graminoids include shoregrass (Monanthochloe littoralis), seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum), and bulrushes (Scirpus spp.). Forbs include dwarf glasswort (Salicornia virginica), sea lavender (Limonium carolinianum), and seacoast sumpweed (Iva annua). Shrubs and half-shrubs are generally sparse in this community, but if present may include sea oxeye (Borrichia frutescens) and wolfberry (Lycium carolinianum). Smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), and saltmarsh bulrush (Bolboschoenus robustus) occur on the more saline areas. Fresher parts of the site are indicated by the presence of Common reed, big cordgrass (Spartina cynosuroides), and seashore paspalum. Shifts in composition may occur due to changes in the water and/or salinity regimes or in response to grazing impacts. Any of these sets of factors may produce similar vegetation responses and thus careful assessment must be made to determine the cause of observed changes. Many of the graminoids become coarse and unpalatable at maturity and fire can be used to stimulate new, more palatable growth and increase production. Improper grazing can cause a decrease in cordgrass, seashore dropseed, and common reed. When they are grazed frequently, they will be eliminated from the site because their root system is unable to recover. When the desirable plants have decreased, less desirable plants such as inland saltgrass and smooth cordgrass start to increase. Cordgrasses and other plants within this community primary reproduce vegetatively by rhizomes, which makes this site very resilient to disturbance. However, once they are eliminated they are hard to reestablish. Reseeding is not an option for this site because most of the seeds from these species are sterile. To reestablish these species transplanting or bringing in rhizomes are possible options for reestablishment. Unwanted species are limited due to the high salinity in the soil. Plants that are intolerant of salt are controlled with a tidal surge or hurricanes.

Reference Community
Smooth cordgrass dominates this community. Smooth cordgrass is adapted to high salinity soils with tidal inundation, wave action, and occasional burial. Average depth of water at high tide ranges from 2 to 12 inches and salinity varies from 12 to 50 parts per thousand, though rainfall may lower salinity. Subdominant grass species include marshhay cordgrass and inland saltgrass (Distichlis spicata). Salt-tolerant forbs such as glassworts and saltworts (Salicornia spp and Batis spp.) may occupy interspaces between cordgrass bunches. This is a highly resilient community and well adapted to storm impacts. Typical recovery time from tropical storms and mild hurricanes is about a year. The site is relatively grazing tolerant due to the low palatability of mature cordgrass. Lack of grazing combined with high resiliency has resulted in many remnant reference sites. Burning is an option to remove rank vegetation, increase palatability, and diversity of plants.

Ecological Site Concept
 The central concept of this site is somewhat isolated from salt water intrusion. The salinity ranges are never high but there is some salinity in the soil that will manifest itself during periods of dry weather. The best indicator plant on this site is seashore Paspalum. Lesser amounts of California bulrush, Olney bulrush, softstem bulrush, marshhay cordgrass, spikesedges, seedbox, Colorado River hemp, and cattails are also found. Elevation, drainage, salinity, water depth, and duration play a major role in the vegetation. Small areas of open water are also included.

The reference plant community is an open grassland with gulf cordgrass, little bluestem, seacoast bluestem, switchgrass, Hartweg's paspalum, seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), marshhay cordgrass, and traces of bushy sea oxeye (Borrichia frutescens). Variations in salinity and soil moisture cause local variations in the plant community, particularly along streams. Studies have shown that length and amount of inundation, and fresh or saltwater runoff have a controlling influence on the post-inundation plant community. Heavy grazing pressure will quickly depress little/seacoast bluestem and lead to a dominance of gulf cordgrass. Inundation with salt water may also cause little/seacoast bluestem to disappear for 2 to 3 years post-inundation. A lengthy inundation with fresh or brackish water may cause the post-inundation community to be dominated by gulf cordgrass.

Ecological Site Concept
 The central concept of this site is somewhat isolated from salt water intrusion. The salinity ranges are never high but there is some salinity in the soil that will manifest itself during periods of dry weather. The best indicator plant on this site is seashore Paspalum. Lesser amounts of California bulrush, Olney bulrush, softstem bulrush, marshhay cordgrass, spikesedges, seedbox, Colorado River hemp, and cattails are also found. Elevation, drainage, salinity, water depth, and duration play a major role in the vegetation. Small areas of open water are also included. These areas are important to waterfowl and other wildlife because habitat diversity. Water salinity level varies throughout the year. Fresher water is indicated by the presence of narrowleaf cattail, seedbox, whorled pennywort, and softstem bulrush.

Soil Features
The soil series in this site concept are Barnett, Harris, Ijam & Leerco. They are very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable firm mineral soils that formed in mineral sediments of Coastal Marshes. Surface runoff and internal drainage are lacking. The soil is permanently saturated to the surface. The soils can support the weight of livestock.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam ecological site typically has a fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam surface. Sandy clay loam subsoil horizons are generally present 15 to 18 inches below the surface.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, moderately well or well drained, with very slow or slow permeability. Other features consist of moderately acid to neutral soil reaction. The dominant surface texture is fine sandy loam with some inclusions of loamy fine sand. Diagnostic features and horizons include an ochric epipedon and argillic horizon. A representative ochric epipedon ranges from 5 to 10 inches thick. Some pedons exhibit vertic properties in the argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Blanconia, Copano, Fulshear, Inez, and Morales.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent grassland composed primarily of tallgrasses and midgrasses that make up to 70 percent of the composition. Forbs make up 5 percent of the composition and woody shrubs, mainly yaupon, American beautyberry, and dewberry (Rubus spp.), comprise 5 percent of the composition. Trees, consisting of either live oak or post oak, dominate the small mottes found on the site. An occasional American elm or hackberry may be found in the tree mix. Productivity is very high and litter accumulates covering approximately 60 to 75 percent. Crusting does not occur on the soil surface and bare ground is less than 10 percent. Native legumes occur in relatively high numbers. Continuous grazing with excessive livestock numbers has had a major impact on the vegetation. The reduction in grass volume also reduces the incidence of wildfires allowing woody seedlings to escape fire and grow large enough to become fire tolerant. Moreover, as overgrazing continues, the more palatable tallgrasses are replaced by less desirable grasses. Basal densities of grass species will decline as does ground litter. Bare ground increases, as does annual production of annual forbs. Soil erosion is not a problem due to the flatness of the landscape. Once the woody invaders to this site such as mesquite, huisache and/or McCartney Rose seedlings appear in small numbers, the window of opportunity to control these plants before they become a serious problem is only very few years. Once the threshold of 15 percent canopy cover is surpassed, control requires a significant amount of resources in time, energy and money to restore the grassland.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses.

Reference Community
The Reference Plant Community for the Blackland is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Composition of tallgrasses make up over 60 percent of annual production, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and associated grasses, forbs, shrubs and woody vines make up the remainder. Historically, bison grazing was intermittent, and fires were both frequent (3 to 8 years) and intense. Annual forbs occur in greater or lesser amounts in response to grazing intensity, fire, drought, or excessive precipitation. This prairie site was heavily grazed by large numbers of domestic livestock by the late 1800's. Overgrazing without rest was exacerbated by the introduction of barbed wire fencing and water development. Overgrazing resulted in reduced production of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrass and some midgrass species and reduction of fire frequency and intensity. Some mid and shortgrasses increased because of this overgrazing and eventually annual forbs and grasses.

The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

The soils are poorly drained to moderately well drained and very deep. Permeability is very slow. The surface texture is typically clay. Soil reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Diagnostic features and horizons include a mollic epipedon, cambic horizon, and vertic features. Soils correlated to this site include: Brazoria, Chicolete, Churnabog, Ganado, Navaca, and Pledger.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
Tidal Flats are areas adjacent to the bay where marshes ebb and flow with water as a result of tide phases.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep and very poorly drained that formed in saline loamy alluvium or eolian coastal deposits. The soils have very slow permeability, strong salinity, and strong sodicity with a neutral through moderately alkaline soil reaction. Soils exhibit halic soil properties along with a peraquic moisture regime. An organic mat of decomposing plant material can be found 1 to 8 inches thick on the surface. Soils correlated to this site include: Follet, Karankawa, Rahal, Tatlum, and Tracosa.

Reference Community
Smooth cordgrass dominates this community. Smooth cordgrass is adapted to high salinity soils with tidal inundation, wave action, and occasional burial. Average depth of water at high tide ranges from 2 to 12 inches and salinity varies from 12 to 50 parts per thousand, though rainfall may lower salinity. Subdominant grass species include marshhay cordgrass and inland saltgrass (Distichlis spicata). Salt-tolerant forbs such as glassworts and saltworts (Salicornia spp and Batis spp.) may occupy interspaces between cordgrass bunches. This is a highly resilient community and well adapted to storm impacts. Typical recovery time from tropical storms and mild hurricanes is about a year. The site is relatively grazing tolerant due to the low palatability of mature cordgrass. Lack of grazing combined with high resiliency has resulted in many remnant reference sites. Burning is an option to remove rank vegetation, increase palatability, and diversity of plants.

Ecological Site Concept
Salt Prairies occur on the inland portion of the Coastal Plains with a mid/tallgrass component on slopes ranging from 0 to 5 percent.

Soil Features
Soils are very deep, very poorly to somewhat poorly drained with very slow to moderate permeability. This site is affected by its degree of salinity and sodicity, more than the influence of the surface texture. Other features include no to very few rock fragments, 0 to 5 percent gypsum, and neutral to strongly alkaline soil reaction. Soils correlated to this site include: Livco, Livia, Matagorda, Narta, Palacios, Porfirio, Sievers, Surfside, and Topo.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is an open grassland with gulf cordgrass, little bluestem, seacoast bluestem, switchgrass, Hartweg's paspalum, seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), marshhay cordgrass, and traces of bushy sea oxeye (Borrichia frutescens). Variations in salinity and soil moisture cause local variations in the plant community, particularly along streams. Studies have shown that length and amount of inundation, and fresh or saltwater runoff have a controlling influence on the post-inundation plant community. Heavy grazing pressure will quickly depress little/seacoast bluestem and lead to a dominance of gulf cordgrass. Inundation with salt water may also cause little/seacoast bluestem to disappear for 2 to 3 years post-inundation. A lengthy inundation with fresh or brackish water may cause the post-inundation community to be dominated by gulf cordgrass.

Ecological Site Concept
Wind Tidal Flats are generally dry, but during times when conditions are right, they are inundated by water from wind action and vegetated with an algal crust.

Soil Features
Soils are poorly or very poorly drained and runoff is negligible or low. Permeability is moderately slow to very slow. A permanent water table fluctuates between the surface to about 18 inches. These soils formed in sandy eolian and storm washover sediments of Holocene age. These soils are frequently flooded for brief periods with salt water, which occur during times of high wind that pushes water onto the wind-tidal flats, storm surge, and heavy rains associated with tropical storms. Soils correlated to this site include: Arrada, Barrada, Satatton and Tatton.

Reference Community
The reference community is dominated by an algal crust on the surface of the soil. Following inundation by climatic events, this area will populate with halophytic vegetation such as glasswort, dwarf saltwort, sea lavender, and sea purslane. The surface salinity rises as the surface dries, and eventually becomes toxic to the plants. The algal crust will also dry up curling at the edges resulting in this site looking like a large mud flat.

The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Bottomland site is very deep with clay surface textures occurring on flood plains. The areas can be flooded and ponded for lengthy durations throughout the year.

Soil Features
The soils are poorly drained to moderately well drained and very deep. Permeability is very slow. The surface texture is typically clay. Soil reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Diagnostic features and horizons include a mollic epipedon, cambic horizon, and vertic features. Soils correlated to this site include: Brazoria, Chicolete, Churnabog, Ganado, Navaca, and Pledger.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
Salt Prairies occur on the inland portion of the Coastal Plains with a mid/tallgrass component on slopes ranging from 0 to 5 percent.

Soil Features
Soils are very deep, very poorly to somewhat poorly drained with very slow to moderate permeability. This site is affected by its degree of salinity and sodicity, more than the influence of the surface texture. Other features include no to very few rock fragments, 0 to 5 percent gypsum, and neutral to strongly alkaline soil reaction. Soils correlated to this site include: Livco, Livia, Matagorda, Narta, Palacios, Porfirio, Sievers, Surfside, and Topo.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is an open grassland with gulf cordgrass, little bluestem, seacoast bluestem, switchgrass, Hartweg's paspalum, seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), marshhay cordgrass, and traces of bushy sea oxeye (Borrichia frutescens). Variations in salinity and soil moisture cause local variations in the plant community, particularly along streams. Studies have shown that length and amount of inundation, and fresh or saltwater runoff have a controlling influence on the post-inundation plant community. Heavy grazing pressure will quickly depress little/seacoast bluestem and lead to a dominance of gulf cordgrass. Inundation with salt water may also cause little/seacoast bluestem to disappear for 2 to 3 years post-inundation. A lengthy inundation with fresh or brackish water may cause the post-inundation community to be dominated by gulf cordgrass.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
Tidal Flats are areas adjacent to the bay where marshes ebb and flow with water as a result of tide phases.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep and very poorly drained that formed in saline loamy alluvium or eolian coastal deposits. The soils have very slow permeability, strong salinity, and strong sodicity with a neutral through moderately alkaline soil reaction. Soils exhibit halic soil properties along with a peraquic moisture regime. An organic mat of decomposing plant material can be found 1 to 8 inches thick on the surface. Soils correlated to this site include: Follet, Karankawa, Rahal, Tatlum, and Tracosa.

Reference Community
Smooth cordgrass dominates this community. Smooth cordgrass is adapted to high salinity soils with tidal inundation, wave action, and occasional burial. Average depth of water at high tide ranges from 2 to 12 inches and salinity varies from 12 to 50 parts per thousand, though rainfall may lower salinity. Subdominant grass species include marshhay cordgrass and inland saltgrass (Distichlis spicata). Salt-tolerant forbs such as glassworts and saltworts (Salicornia spp and Batis spp.) may occupy interspaces between cordgrass bunches. This is a highly resilient community and well adapted to storm impacts. Typical recovery time from tropical storms and mild hurricanes is about a year. The site is relatively grazing tolerant due to the low palatability of mature cordgrass. Lack of grazing combined with high resiliency has resulted in many remnant reference sites. Burning is an option to remove rank vegetation, increase palatability, and diversity of plants.

Reference Community
The reference community is a mixture of mid and tallgrasses making up greater than 80 percent of the biomass.

Interstitial graminoids include shoregrass (Monanthochloe littoralis), seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum), and bulrushes (Scirpus spp.). Forbs include dwarf glasswort (Salicornia virginica), sea lavender (Limonium carolinianum), and seacoast sumpweed (Iva annua). Shrubs and half-shrubs are generally sparse in this community, but if present may include sea oxeye (Borrichia frutescens) and wolfberry (Lycium carolinianum). Smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), and saltmarsh bulrush (Bolboschoenus robustus) occur on the more saline areas. Fresher parts of the site are indicated by the presence of Common reed, big cordgrass (Spartina cynosuroides), and seashore paspalum. Shifts in composition may occur due to changes in the water and/or salinity regimes or in response to grazing impacts. Any of these sets of factors may produce similar vegetation responses and thus careful assessment must be made to determine the cause of observed changes. Many of the graminoids become coarse and unpalatable at maturity and fire can be used to stimulate new, more palatable growth and increase production. Improper grazing can cause a decrease in cordgrass, seashore dropseed, and common reed. When they are grazed frequently, they will be eliminated from the site because their root system is unable to recover. When the desirable plants have decreased, less desirable plants such as inland saltgrass and smooth cordgrass start to increase. Cordgrasses and other plants within this community primary reproduce vegetatively by rhizomes, which makes this site very resilient to disturbance. However, once they are eliminated they are hard to reestablish. Reseeding is not an option for this site because most of the seeds from these species are sterile. To reestablish these species transplanting or bringing in rhizomes are possible options for reestablishment. Unwanted species are limited due to the high salinity in the soil.

Ecological Site Concept
Salt Prairies occur on the inland portion of the Coastal Plains with a mid/tallgrass component on slopes ranging from 0 to 5 percent.

Soil Features
Soils are very deep, very poorly to somewhat poorly drained with very slow to moderate permeability. This site is affected by its degree of salinity and sodicity, more than the influence of the surface texture. Other features include no to very few rock fragments, 0 to 5 percent gypsum, and neutral to strongly alkaline soil reaction. Soils correlated to this site include: Livco, Livia, Matagorda, Narta, Palacios, Porfirio, Sievers, Surfside, and Topo.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is an open grassland with gulf cordgrass, little bluestem, seacoast bluestem, switchgrass, Hartweg's paspalum, seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), marshhay cordgrass, and traces of bushy sea oxeye (Borrichia frutescens). Variations in salinity and soil moisture cause local variations in the plant community, particularly along streams. Studies have shown that length and amount of inundation, and fresh or saltwater runoff have a controlling influence on the post-inundation plant community. Heavy grazing pressure will quickly depress little/seacoast bluestem and lead to a dominance of gulf cordgrass. Inundation with salt water may also cause little/seacoast bluestem to disappear for 2 to 3 years post-inundation. A lengthy inundation with fresh or brackish water may cause the post-inundation community to be dominated by gulf cordgrass.

The reference community is a mixture of mid and tallgrasses making up greater than 80 percent of the biomass. Dominant grasses include marshhay cordgrass (Spartina patens), common reed (Phragmites australis), and seashore dropseed (Sporobolus virginicus). Interstitial graminoids include shoregrass (Monanthochloe littoralis), seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum), and bulrushes (Scirpus spp.). Forbs include dwarf glasswort (Salicornia virginica), sea lavender (Limonium carolinianum), and seacoast sumpweed (Iva annua). Shrubs and half-shrubs are generally sparse in this community, but if present may include sea oxeye (Borrichia frutescens) and wolfberry (Lycium carolinianum). Smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), and saltmarsh bulrush (Bolboschoenus robustus) occur on the more saline areas. Fresher parts of the site are indicated by the presence of Common reed, big cordgrass (Spartina cynosuroides), and seashore paspalum. Shifts in composition may occur due to changes in the water and/or salinity regimes or in response to grazing impacts. Any of these sets of factors may produce similar vegetation responses and thus careful assessment must be made to determine the cause of observed changes. Many of the graminoids become coarse and unpalatable at maturity and fire can be used to stimulate new, more palatable growth and increase production. Improper grazing can cause a decrease in cordgrass, seashore dropseed, and common reed. When they are grazed frequently, they will be eliminated from the site because their root system is unable to recover. When the desirable plants have decreased, less desirable plants such as inland saltgrass and smooth cordgrass start to increase. Cordgrasses and other plants within this community primary reproduce vegetatively by rhizomes, which makes this site very resilient to disturbance. However, once they are eliminated they are hard to reestablish. Reseeding is not an option for this site because most of the seeds from these species are sterile. To reestablish these species transplanting or bringing in rhizomes are possible options for reestablishment. Unwanted species are limited due to the high salinity in the soil. Plants that are intolerant of salt are controlled with a tidal surge or hurricanes.

Reference Community
The Brackish Firm Mineral Marsh ecological site can potentially support a somewhat diverse mixture of grasses, grass-like plants, and forbs. Marshhay cordgrass is the dominant species in this plant community and is the plant that management considerations are based on. Marshhay cordgrass is typically found where salinity levels are between 3 and 9 ppt and water depth is up to 6 inches. Secondary herbaceous vegetation is directly influenced by factors such as elevation, water depth, and salinity. Variations in one or more of these factors can result in the plant community shifting back and forth from species that are typically associated with more saline conditions to species that are generally associated with fresh marsh. Seashore paspalum, Olney bulrush (three-corner grass), saltmarsh bulrush (leafy three-square) and California bulrush (bullwhip) are the most significant sub-dominant species. Seashore saltgrass is usually found in the small drainageways within the site. It can withstand more saline conditions and longer periods of inundation than marshhay cordgrass. Low growing and sod-forming grasses and grass-like plants such as dwarf spikerush, and fragrant flatsedge are minor components of this plant community. Roseau cane (common reed) occurs in areas that are fresher or slightly elevated. The primary forbs found on this site are cattail, saltmarsh morningglory, and saltmarsh mallow. Widgeongrass is a submerged aquatic species that is typically found in open water areas within the brackish marsh and is an excellent duck food. Shrubs are rare to non-existent on this site in its pristine state, however a few widely scattered shrubs may occur. Those shrubby species may include bigleaf sumpweed (marsh elder), eastern baccharis, and wolfberry. Fire is a major mangaement tool for this plant community. Without fire the accumulated rough of marshhay cordgrass not only suppresses other vegetation, but it can also reduce its own annual production because the old growth suppresses the potential for new, vigorous growth. Prescribed fire allows species such as dwarf spikerush and seashore saltgrass to increase both spatially and in biomass production.

Soil Features
Soils are very deep, very poorly to somewhat poorly drained with very slow to moderate permeability.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is an open grassland with gulf cordgrass, little bluestem, seacoast bluestem, switchgrass, Hartweg's paspalum, seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), marshhay cordgrass, and traces of bushy sea oxeye (Borrichia frutescens). Variations in salinity and soil moisture cause local variations in the plant community, particularly along streams. Studies have shown that length and amount of inundation, and fresh or saltwater runoff have a controlling influence on the post-inundation plant community. Heavy grazing pressure will quickly depress little/seacoast bluestem and lead to a dominance of gulf cordgrass. Inundation with salt water may also cause little/seacoast bluestem to disappear for 2 to 3 years post-inundation. A lengthy inundation with fresh or brackish water may cause the post-inundation community to be dominated by gulf cordgrass.

Smooth cordgrass dominates this community. Smooth cordgrass is adapted to high salinity soils with tidal inundation, wave action, and occasional burial. Average depth of water at high tide ranges from 2 to 12 inches and salinity varies from 12 to 50 parts per thousand, though rainfall may lower salinity. Subdominant grass species include marshhay cordgrass and inland saltgrass (Distichlis spicata).

This is a highly resilient community and well adapted to storm impacts. Typical recovery time from tropical storms and mild hurricanes is about a year. The site is relatively grazing tolerant due to the low palatability of mature cordgrass. Lack of grazing combined with high resiliency has resulted in many remnant reference sites. Burning is an option to remove rank vegetation, increase palatability, and diversity of plants.

Ecological Site Concept
Tidal Flats are areas adjacent to the bay where marshes ebb and flow with water as a result of tide phases.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep and very poorly drained that formed in saline loamy alluvium or eolian coastal deposits. The soils have very slow permeability, strong salinity, and strong sodicity with a neutral through moderately alkaline soil reaction. Soils exhibit halic soil properties along with a peraquic moisture regime. An organic mat of decomposing plant material can be found 1 to 8 inches thick on the surface. Soils correlated to this site include: Follet, Karankawa, Rahal, Tatlum, and Tracosa.

Reference Community
Smooth cordgrass dominates this community. Smooth cordgrass is adapted to high salinity soils with tidal inundation, wave action, and occasional burial. Average depth of water at high tide ranges from 2 to 12 inches and salinity varies from 12 to 50 parts per thousand, though rainfall may lower salinity. Subdominant grass species include marshhay cordgrass and inland saltgrass (Distichlis spicata). Salt-tolerant forbs such as glassworts and saltworts (Salicornia spp and Batis spp.) may occupy interspaces between cordgrass bunches. This is a highly resilient community and well adapted to storm impacts. Typical recovery time from tropical storms and mild hurricanes is about a year. The site is relatively grazing tolerant due to the low palatability of mature cordgrass. Lack of grazing combined with high resiliency has resulted in many remnant reference sites. Burning is an option to remove rank vegetation, increase palatability, and diversity of plants.

Ecological Site Concept
Northern Coastal Sands are sandy-textured ecological sites positioned in front and behind Coastal Dunes. Northern Coastal Sands do not pond and have a water table below 40 inches.

Soil Features
The soils are of very deep, moderately well to somewhat excessively drained, with very rapid permeability. Surface textures include fine sand, loamy fine sand, and sand. Soils are commonly non-saline and non-sodic. Other soil features include no to little calcium carbonate percentage and moderately acid to moderately alkaline soil reactions. Soil correlated to this site include: Galveston.

Reference Community
The Tall/Midgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is the reference community. Seacoast bluestem (also known as shore little bluestem) dominates this site. Other important associated grasses include gulfdune paspalum and brownseed paspalum. It also supports a diverse understory community of perennial legumes and other forbs. Under heavy grazing and elimination of fire, the community will shift from an open tallgrass/midgrass prairie to a Midgrass Community (1.2). Like other prairie ecological sites, woody species are present, but only in sparse amounts. Occasional fires or hurricanes help manage the density of woody vegetation. Woody canopy cover exceeding 15 percent indicates a transition to the Shrubland State (2). The driving factor is the size of woody plants, which relates to reproductive capability. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State (2) are resprouting species, the transition starts to increase soon after fire or brush control ceases. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 15 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process. Managers need to monitor the increase in woody species and realize that when canopy approaches 15 percent a threshold is about to be crossed. There is a 3 to 5-year window of action before the rapid transition to the Shrubland State occurs.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
Northern Coastal Sands are sandy-textured ecological sites positioned in front and behind Coastal Dunes. Northern Coastal Sands do not pond and have a water table below 40 inches.

Soil Features
The soils are of very deep, moderately well to somewhat excessively drained, with very rapid permeability. Surface textures include fine sand, loamy fine sand, and sand. Soils are commonly non-saline and non-sodic. Other soil features include no to little calcium carbonate percentage and moderately acid to moderately alkaline soil reactions. Soil correlated to this site include: Galveston.

Reference Community
The Tall/Midgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is the reference community. Seacoast bluestem (also known as shore little bluestem) dominates this site. Other important associated grasses include gulfdune paspalum and brownseed paspalum. It also supports a diverse understory community of perennial legumes and other forbs. Under heavy grazing and elimination of fire, the community will shift from an open tallgrass/midgrass prairie to a Midgrass Community (1.2). Like other prairie ecological sites, woody species are present, but only in sparse amounts. Occasional fires or hurricanes help manage the density of woody vegetation. Woody canopy cover exceeding 15 percent indicates a transition to the Shrubland State (2). The driving factor is the size of woody plants, which relates to reproductive capability. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State (2) are resprouting species, the transition starts to increase soon after fire or brush control ceases. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 15 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process. Managers need to monitor the increase in woody species and realize that when canopy approaches 15 percent a threshold is about to be crossed. There is a 3 to 5-year window of action before the rapid transition to the Shrubland State occurs.

Seacoast bluestem occurs on moderately drained flats and swales while bushy bluestem occurs in poorly drained areas. American bulrush is also associated with these grass communities in poorly drained areas. Other important associated perennial and annual forbs include mistflower (Conoclinium coelestinum), sea lavender (Limonium carolinianum), bushy sea-ox-eye, and narrowleaf marshelder. Heavy grazing results in a change in the plant community composition by strongly reducing the occurrence of gulfdune paspalum and increasing the abundance of forbs.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
Blacklands consist of very deep, moderately well to well drained, very slowly permeable, slightly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Soils correlated to this site include: Banquete, Contee, Laewest, Marcado, and Victoria.

Reference Community
The Reference Plant Community for the Blackland is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Composition of tallgrasses make up over 60 percent of annual production, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and associated grasses, forbs, shrubs and woody vines make up the remainder. Historically, bison grazing was intermittent, and fires were both frequent (3 to 8 years) and intense. Annual forbs occur in greater or lesser amounts in response to grazing intensity, fire, drought, or excessive precipitation. This prairie site was heavily grazed by large numbers of domestic livestock by the late 1800's. Overgrazing without rest was exacerbated by the introduction of barbed wire fencing and water development. Overgrazing resulted in reduced production of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrass and some midgrass species and reduction of fire frequency and intensity. Some mid and shortgrasses increased because of this overgrazing and eventually annual forbs and grasses.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Ecological Site Concept
 The central concept of this site is somewhat isolated from salt water intrusion. The salinity ranges are never high but there is some salinity in the soil that will manifest itself during periods of dry weather. The best indicator plant on this site is seashore Paspalum. Lesser amounts of California bulrush, Olney bulrush, softstem bulrush, marshhay cordgrass, spikesedges, seedbox, Colorado River hemp, and cattails are also found. Elevation, drainage, salinity, water depth, and duration play a major role in the vegetation. Small areas of open water are also included. These areas are important to waterfowl and other wildlife because habitat diversity. Water salinity level varies throughout the year. Fresher water is indicated by the presence of narrowleaf cattail, seedbox, whorled pennywort, and softstem bulrush.

Soil Features
The soil series in this site concept are Barnett, Harris, Ijam & Leerco. They are very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable firm mineral soils that formed in mineral sediments of Coastal Marshes. Surface runoff and internal drainage are lacking.

Ecological Site Concept
Salt Marshes are closed depressions of the inland Coastal Plains exhibiting salt-tolerant vegetation.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, saline, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. Tidal influence and salty substrates produce saline to brackish conditions. However, at any given location, the degree of salinity is a result of the local interaction of tidal influence, freshwater inflows, and substrate salt content. This site has an Aquic soil moisture regime with gleyed colors throughout the profile. Other features include moderate to strong sodicity and neutral to strong alkalinity. Soil correlated to this site include: Harris, Placedo, Swan, and Velasco.

Reference Community
The reference community is a mixture of mid and tallgrasses making up greater than 80 percent of the biomass. Dominant grasses include marshhay cordgrass (Spartina patens), common reed (Phragmites australis), and seashore dropseed (Sporobolus virginicus). Interstitial graminoids include shoregrass (Monanthochloe littoralis), seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum), and bulrushes (Scirpus spp.). Forbs include dwarf glasswort (Salicornia virginica), sea lavender (Limonium carolinianum), and seacoast sumpweed (Iva annua). Shrubs and half-shrubs are generally sparse in this community, but if present may include sea oxeye (Borrichia frutescens) and wolfberry (Lycium carolinianum). Smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), and saltmarsh bulrush (Bolboschoenus robustus) occur on the more saline areas. Fresher parts of the site are indicated by the presence of Common reed, big cordgrass (Spartina cynosuroides), and seashore paspalum. Shifts in composition may occur due to changes in the water and/or salinity regimes or in response to grazing impacts. Any of these sets of factors may produce similar vegetation responses and thus careful assessment must be made to determine the cause of observed changes. Many of the graminoids become coarse and unpalatable at maturity and fire can be used to stimulate new, more palatable growth and increase production. Improper grazing can cause a decrease in cordgrass, seashore dropseed, and common reed. When they are grazed frequently, they will be eliminated from the site because their root system is unable to recover. When the desirable plants have decreased, less desirable plants such as inland saltgrass and smooth cordgrass start to increase. Cordgrasses and other plants within this community primary reproduce vegetatively by rhizomes, which makes this site very resilient to disturbance. However, once they are eliminated they are hard to reestablish. Reseeding is not an option for this site because most of the seeds from these species are sterile. To reestablish these species transplanting or bringing in rhizomes are possible options for reestablishment. Unwanted species are limited due to the high salinity in the soil. Plants that are intolerant of salt are controlled with a tidal surge or hurricanes.

When they are grazed frequently, they will be eliminated from the site because their root system is unable to recover. When the desirable plants have decreased, less desirable plants such as inland saltgrass and smooth cordgrass start to increase. Cordgrasses and other plants within this community primary reproduce vegetatively by rhizomes, which makes this site very resilient to disturbance. However, once they are eliminated they are hard to reestablish. Reseeding is not an option for this site because most of the seeds from these species are sterile. To reestablish these species transplanting or bringing in rhizomes are possible options for reestablishment. Unwanted species are limited due to the high salinity in the soil. Plants that are intolerant of salt are controlled with a tidal surge or hurricanes.

Ecological Site Concept
Tidal Flats are areas adjacent to the bay where marshes ebb and flow with water as a result of tide phases.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep and very poorly drained that formed in saline loamy alluvium or eolian coastal deposits. The soils have very slow permeability, strong salinity, and strong sodicity with a neutral through moderately alkaline soil reaction. Soils exhibit halic soil properties along with a peraquic moisture regime. An organic mat of decomposing plant material can be found 1 to 8 inches thick on the surface. Soils correlated to this site include: Follet, Karankawa, Rahal, Tatlum, and Tracosa.

Reference Community
Smooth cordgrass dominates this community. Smooth cordgrass is adapted to high salinity soils with tidal inundation, wave action, and occasional burial. Average depth of water at high tide ranges from 2 to 12 inches and salinity varies from 12 to 50 parts per thousand, though rainfall may lower salinity. Subdominant grass species include marshhay cordgrass and inland saltgrass (Distichlis spicata). Salt-tolerant forbs such as glassworts and saltworts (Salicornia spp and Batis spp.) may occupy interspaces between cordgrass bunches. This is a highly resilient community and well adapted to storm impacts. Typical recovery time from tropical storms and mild hurricanes is about a year. The site is relatively grazing tolerant due to the low palatability of mature cordgrass. Lack of grazing combined with high resiliency has resulted in many remnant reference sites.

Variations in salinity and soil moisture cause local variations in the plant community, particularly along streams. Studies have shown that length and amount of inundation, and fresh or saltwater runoff have a controlling influence on the post-inundation plant community. Heavy grazing pressure will quickly depress little/seacoast bluestem and lead to a dominance of gulf cordgrass. Inundation with salt water may also cause little/seacoast bluestem to disappear for 2 to 3 years post-inundation. A lengthy inundation with fresh or brackish water may cause the post-inundation community to be dominated by gulf cordgrass.

The Clayey Bottomland site is very deep with clay surface textures occurring on flood plains. The areas can be flooded and ponded for lengthy durations throughout the year.

Soil Features
The soils are poorly drained to moderately well drained and very deep. Permeability is very slow. The surface texture is typically clay. Soil reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Diagnostic features and horizons include a mollic epipedon, cambic horizon, and vertic features. Soils correlated to this site include: Brazoria, Chicolete, Churnabog, Ganado, Navaca, and Pledger.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Reference Community
The Tall/Midgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is the reference community. Seacoast bluestem (also known as shore little bluestem) dominates this site. Other important associated grasses include gulfdune paspalum and brownseed paspalum. It also supports a diverse understory community of perennial legumes and other forbs. Under heavy grazing and elimination of fire, the community will shift from an open tallgrass/midgrass prairie to a Midgrass Community (1.2). Like other prairie ecological sites, woody species are present, but only in sparse amounts. Occasional fires or hurricanes help manage the density of woody vegetation. Woody canopy cover exceeding 15 percent indicates a transition to the Shrubland State (2). The driving factor is the size of woody plants, which relates to reproductive capability. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State (2) are resprouting species, the transition starts to increase soon after fire or brush control ceases. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 15 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process. Managers need to monitor the increase in woody species and realize that when canopy approaches 15 percent a threshold is about to be crossed. There is a 3 to 5-year window of action before the rapid transition to the Shrubland State occurs.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing.

Recurrent fire, primarily during the summers and periodic grazing by bison were natural processes, which maintained this plant community. Under continuous, heavy livestock grazing the taller, more palatable bunchgrasses such as big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, Florida paspalum, and switchgrass decrease and are replaced by mid and shortgrasses. Subsequently, with the resulting reduced fuel loads, fire frequency and intensity decreased. As the process continued, these plants were replaced by even less palatable, less productive midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs.

Important commercial tree species include loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, and longleaf pine. These soils are suited for pines, and the site index for loblolly pine is 80. The yield from an unmanaged stand of loblolly pine over a 50-year period is approximately 230 board feet (Doyle rule) per acre per year. Native species important to wildlife include post oak, dogwood, and yaupon. High value grasses and forbs used by livestock include pinehill bluestem, little bluestem, longleaf uniola, and indiangrass. Stocking rates depend on canopy density and range from 8-40 acres per animal unit."|"21692378"|"21984486"

The ""26 d5sk-Lake Charles-Urban land complex"" mapunit was combined with the ""26 2zqx1-Lake Charles- Urban land complex, 0 to 3 percent slopes"" map unit as a result of the ""MLRA 150A - Lake Charles - Urban land complex"" EVAL project"".
The ""35 d5sw-Norwood-Asa complex, 1 to 8 percent slopes, rarely flooded"" mapunit was combined with the ""35 2zrtz-Norwood-Asa silt loams complex, 1 to 8 percent slopes, rarely flooded"" map unit as a result of the ""MLRA 150A - Norwood-Asa complex, 1 to 8 percent slopes, rarely flooded"" EVAL project"".
The tabular database was edited and populated according to guidance in Exhibits A and B of National Instruction (NI-305), and Part 610 of the National Soil Survey Handbook. Any spatial data edits were certified correct by the Soil Survey region GIS specialist, State Soil Scientist (SSS), and by the National Digitizing Center. The SSS certified the data population for all map units, and concurred with correlation of all projects mentioned, as they were documented in Soil Survey Area Legend(s), and in the Project Correlation tables.

The SSS certified the data population for all map units, and concurred with correlation of all projects mentioned, as they were documented in Soil Survey Area Legend(s) and in the Project Correlation table.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Prairie has very deep sandy soils on uplands. The sands are generally greater than 20 inches deep before reaching a sandy clay loam subsurface horizon.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained, very slowly to moderately rapidly permeable soils. The surface is typically loamy fine sand. Generally, the soils are taxonomically classified as Arenic, but other classifications may be present. The argillic horizon textures range from fine sandy loam to clay loam. Argillic horizons exhibit redoximorphic features and even include plinthite in some pedons. A perched water table on top of the argillic can result following periods of heavy rain events. Soils correlated to this site include: Cheetham, Fordtran, Garcitas, Milby, and Monaville.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a tall/midgrass prairie. It is a fire-maintained, bunchgrass prairie composed of primarily warm-season, tall and midgrasses with a few warm-season perennial forbs and cool-season grasses and forbs. Recurrent fire, primarily during the summers and periodic grazing by bison were natural processes, which maintained this plant community. Under continuous, heavy livestock grazing the taller, more palatable bunchgrasses such as big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, Florida paspalum, and switchgrass decrease and are replaced by mid and shortgrasses. Subsequently, with the resulting reduced fuel loads, fire frequency and intensity decreased. As the process continued, these plants were replaced by even less palatable, less productive midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Bottomland site is very deep with clay surface textures occurring on flood plains. The areas can be flooded and ponded for lengthy durations throughout the year.

Soil Features
The soils are poorly drained to moderately well drained and very deep. Permeability is very slow. The surface texture is typically clay. Soil reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Diagnostic features and horizons include a mollic epipedon, cambic horizon, and vertic features. Soils correlated to this site include: Brazoria, Chicolete, Churnabog, Ganado, Navaca, and Pledger.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
The ecological site has very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that are occasionally flooded. The sites will typically stay flooded longest during the periods of November to May. Due to their coarse-textured soils, the sites drain quicker and do not stay flooded as long as the loamy and clayey bottomlands sites. The drainage patterns and sandy soils create their unique plant community.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium of Holocene age. Soils correlated to this site include: Zalco.

Reference Community
The reference plant community of this site is a savannah. Cottonwood, elm, water oak, ash, pecan, black willow (Salix nigra), and sycamore (Plantanus occidentalis) trees provide about 30 percent canopy cover. The overstory canopy is denser immediately adjacent to the watercourse. The understory includes greenbrier (Smilax spp.), grape (Vitis spp.), and honeysuckle (Symphorcarpos spp.). Switchgrass, Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), little bluestem, and big bluestem dominate the herbaceous plant community. Continuous-yearlong abusive grazing for a succession of years will tend to move the herbaceous plant community towards a herbaceous community of midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually only forbs.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Bottomland site is very deep with clay surface textures occurring on flood plains. The areas can be flooded and ponded for lengthy durations throughout the year.

Soil Features
The soils are poorly drained to moderately well drained and very deep. Permeability is very slow. The surface texture is typically clay. Soil reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Diagnostic features and horizons include a mollic epipedon, cambic horizon, and vertic features. Soils correlated to this site include: Brazoria, Chicolete, Churnabog, Ganado, Navaca, and Pledger.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

This reference plant community is a fire-dependent grassland composed primarily of tallgrasses and midgrasses that make up to 70 percent of the composition. Forbs make up 5 percent of the composition and woody shrubs, mainly yaupon, American beautyberry, and dewberry (Rubus spp.), comprise 5 percent of the composition. Trees, consisting of either live oak or post oak, dominate the small mottes found on the site. An occasional American elm or hackberry may be found in the tree mix. Productivity is very high and litter accumulates covering approximately 60 to 75 percent. Crusting does not occur on the soil surface and bare ground is less than 10 percent. Native legumes occur in relatively high numbers. Continuous grazing with excessive livestock numbers has had a major impact on the vegetation. The reduction in grass volume also reduces the incidence of wildfires allowing woody seedlings to escape fire and grow large enough to become fire tolerant. Moreover, as overgrazing continues, the more palatable tallgrasses are replaced by less desirable grasses. Basal densities of grass species will decline as does ground litter. Bare ground increases, as does annual production of annual forbs. Soil erosion is not a problem due to the flatness of the landscape. Once the woody invaders to this site such as mesquite, huisache and/or McCartney Rose seedlings appear in small numbers, the window of opportunity to control these plants before they become a serious problem is only very few years. Once the threshold of 15 percent canopy cover is surpassed, control requires a significant amount of resources in time, energy and money to restore the grassland.

Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

The Clayey Bottomland site is very deep with clay surface textures occurring on flood plains. The areas can be flooded and ponded for lengthy durations throughout the year.

Soil Features
The soils are poorly drained to moderately well drained and very deep. Permeability is very slow. The surface texture is typically clay. Soil reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Diagnostic features and horizons include a mollic epipedon, cambic horizon, and vertic features. Soils correlated to this site include: Brazoria, Chicolete, Churnabog, Ganado, Navaca, and Pledger.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei).

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Bottomland site is very deep with clay surface textures occurring on flood plains. The areas can be flooded and ponded for lengthy durations throughout the year.

Soil Features
The soils are poorly drained to moderately well drained and very deep. Permeability is very slow. The surface texture is typically clay. Soil reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Diagnostic features and horizons include a mollic epipedon, cambic horizon, and vertic features. Soils correlated to this site include: Brazoria, Chicolete, Churnabog, Ganado, Navaca, and Pledger.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam ecological site typically has a fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam surface. Sandy clay loam subsoil horizons are generally present 15 to 18 inches below the surface.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, moderately well or well drained, with very slow or slow permeability. Other features consist of moderately acid to neutral soil reaction. The dominant surface texture is fine sandy loam with some inclusions of loamy fine sand. Diagnostic features and horizons include an ochric epipedon and argillic horizon. A representative ochric epipedon ranges from 5 to 10 inches thick. Some pedons exhibit vertic properties in the argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Blanconia, Copano, Fulshear, Inez, and Morales.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent grassland composed primarily of tallgrasses and midgrasses that make up to 70 percent of the composition. Forbs make up 5 percent of the composition and woody shrubs, mainly yaupon, American beautyberry, and dewberry (Rubus spp.), comprise 5 percent of the composition. Trees, consisting of either live oak or post oak, dominate the small mottes found on the site. An occasional American elm or hackberry may be found in the tree mix. Productivity is very high and litter accumulates covering approximately 60 to 75 percent. Crusting does not occur on the soil surface and bare ground is less than 10 percent. Native legumes occur in relatively high numbers. Continuous grazing with excessive livestock numbers has had a major impact on the vegetation. The reduction in grass volume also reduces the incidence of wildfires allowing woody seedlings to escape fire and grow large enough to become fire tolerant. Moreover, as overgrazing continues, the more palatable tallgrasses are replaced by less desirable grasses. Basal densities of grass species will decline as does ground litter. Bare ground increases, as does annual production of annual forbs. Soil erosion is not a problem due to the flatness of the landscape. Once the woody invaders to this site such as mesquite, huisache and/or McCartney Rose seedlings appear in small numbers, the window of opportunity to control these plants before they become a serious problem is only very few years. Once the threshold of 15 percent canopy cover is surpassed, control requires a significant amount of resources in time, energy and money to restore the grassland.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam site are upland sites with sandy surface soils over loamy subsoils. The surface soils are usually less than 10 inches deep. The site is one of most vegetatively productive uplands sites in the MLRA.

Soil Features
The soils are moderately deep to very deep fine sandy loams and loamy fine sands with a minimum thickness of 10 inches. The sandy surface is underlain by clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam subsoil. Moisture from light showers is readily absorbed by the surface soil, and the subsoil takes in water moderately well. Fertility and water holding capacity are moderate in the surface and high in the subsoil. Air, water, and plant roots move through the soil readily. The soils give up water generously to growing plants. Surface crusts, slower water intake, and increased runoff are characteristics of the soils in a deteriorated condition. Soils correlated to this site include: Alum, Bastrop, Chazos, Dubina, Gasil, Gause, Gholson, Hammond, Inez, Marquez, Minerva, Personville, Rosanky, Shiro, Silawa, Spiller, and Travis.

Reference Community
The interpretive plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is a fire-driven savannah of post oak and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) trees that shade 15 to 20 percent of the ground. The herbaceous component of tall and midgrasses and is dominated by little bluestem, Indiangrass, and brownseed paspalum (Paspalum plicatulum), which usually make up 50 to 75 percent of the total annual yield. Purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus), Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum), switchgrass, tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), and thin paspalum (Paspalum setaceum) also occur. Cool season plants occuring on the site include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia pinnatifida), and sedges (Carex spp.). A variety of shrubs, vines, and forbs occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the reference herbaceous plant community and the savannah landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing, over rest, and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species such as eastern persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), and winged elm (Ulmus alata). Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to the Shrubland State.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam ecological site typically has a fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam surface. Sandy clay loam subsoil horizons are generally present 15 to 18 inches below the surface.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, moderately well or well drained, with very slow or slow permeability. Other features consist of moderately acid to neutral soil reaction. The dominant surface texture is fine sandy loam with some inclusions of loamy fine sand. Diagnostic features and horizons include an ochric epipedon and argillic horizon. A representative ochric epipedon ranges from 5 to 10 inches thick. Some pedons exhibit vertic properties in the argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Blanconia, Copano, Fulshear, Inez, and Morales.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent grassland composed primarily of tallgrasses and midgrasses that make up to 70 percent of the composition. Forbs make up 5 percent of the composition and woody shrubs, mainly yaupon, American beautyberry, and dewberry (Rubus spp.), comprise 5 percent of the composition. Trees, consisting of either live oak or post oak, dominate the small mottes found on the site. An occasional American elm or hackberry may be found in the tree mix. Productivity is very high and litter accumulates covering approximately 60 to 75 percent. Crusting does not occur on the soil surface and bare ground is less than 10 percent. Native legumes occur in relatively high numbers. Continuous grazing with excessive livestock numbers has had a major impact on the vegetation. The reduction in grass volume also reduces the incidence of wildfires allowing woody seedlings to escape fire and grow large enough to become fire tolerant. Moreover, as overgrazing continues, the more palatable tallgrasses are replaced by less desirable grasses. Basal densities of grass species will decline as does ground litter. Bare ground increases, as does annual production of annual forbs. Soil erosion is not a problem due to the flatness of the landscape. Once the woody invaders to this site such as mesquite, huisache and/or McCartney Rose seedlings appear in small numbers, the window of opportunity to control these plants before they become a serious problem is only very few years. Once the threshold of 15 percent canopy cover is surpassed, control requires a significant amount of resources in time, energy and money to restore the grassland.

Trees, consisting of either live oak or post oak, dominate the small mottes found on the site. An occasional American elm or hackberry may be found in the tree mix. Productivity is very high and litter accumulates covering approximately 60 to 75 percent. Crusting does not occur on the soil surface and bare ground is less than 10 percent. Native legumes occur in relatively high numbers. Continuous grazing with excessive livestock numbers has had a major impact on the vegetation. The reduction in grass volume also reduces the incidence of wildfires allowing woody seedlings to escape fire and grow large enough to become fire tolerant. Moreover, as overgrazing continues, the more palatable tallgrasses are replaced by less desirable grasses. Basal densities of grass species will decline as does ground litter. Bare ground increases, as does annual production of annual forbs. Soil erosion is not a problem due to the flatness of the landscape. Once the woody invaders to this site such as mesquite, huisache and/or McCartney Rose seedlings appear in small numbers, the window of opportunity to control these plants before they become a serious problem is only very few years. Once the threshold of 15 percent canopy cover is surpassed, control requires a significant amount of resources in time, energy and money to restore the grassland.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Prairie has very deep sandy soils on uplands. The sands are generally greater than 20 inches deep before reaching a sandy clay loam subsurface horizon.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained, very slowly to moderately rapidly permeable soils. The surface is typically loamy fine sand. Generally, the soils are taxonomically classified as Arenic, but other classifications may be present. The argillic horizon textures range from fine sandy loam to clay loam. Argillic horizons exhibit redoximorphic features and even include plinthite in some pedons. A perched water table on top of the argillic can result following periods of heavy rain events. Soils correlated to this site include: Cheetham, Fordtran, Garcitas, Milby, and Monaville.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a tall/midgrass prairie. It is a fire-maintained, bunchgrass prairie composed of primarily warm-season, tall and midgrasses with a few warm-season perennial forbs and cool-season grasses and forbs. Recurrent fire, primarily during the summers and periodic grazing by bison were natural processes, which maintained this plant community. Under continuous, heavy livestock grazing the taller, more palatable bunchgrasses such as big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, Florida paspalum, and switchgrass decrease and are replaced by mid and shortgrasses. Subsequently, with the resulting reduced fuel loads, fire frequency and intensity decreased. As the process continued, these plants were replaced by even less palatable, less productive midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile. Runoff is low and erosion is negligible.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

The plants are adapted to withstand flooding and dryness because of the rapid permeability.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, moderately well drained and well drained soils formed from sandy sediments and loamy alluvium. Hatliff and Voss are the representative series and are classified as a coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Fluventic Dystrudept and a mixed, thermic, Oxyaquic Udipsamment, respectively. As with soils that are entisols and inceptisols, extensive horizon development has not occurred. The horizons are generally separated by a change in color as their textures are similar throughout the entire profile. The subsurface is saturated for at least 20 consecutive days, or 30 cumulative days throughout the year.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine and American beech. Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and water oak (Quercus nigra) are common and an occasional swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii) will be mixed in. Shrub species can vary, but American hornbeam is prolific, with eastern baccharis (Baccharis halimifolia) and witchhazel (Hamamelis virginiana) mixed in. Since the overstory canopy is somewhat closed, grass and forb species can be sparse. Thick stands of switchcane and broadleaf uniola will be present nearest the waterway where more sunlight exists. These species also stabilize the soil with their roots.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam ecological site typically has a fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam surface. Sandy clay loam subsoil horizons are generally present 15 to 18 inches below the surface.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, moderately well or well drained, with very slow or slow permeability. Other features consist of moderately acid to neutral soil reaction. The dominant surface texture is fine sandy loam with some inclusions of loamy fine sand. Diagnostic features and horizons include an ochric epipedon and argillic horizon. A representative ochric epipedon ranges from 5 to 10 inches thick. Some pedons exhibit vertic properties in the argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Blanconia, Copano, Fulshear, Inez, and Morales.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent grassland composed primarily of tallgrasses and midgrasses that make up to 70 percent of the composition. Forbs make up 5 percent of the composition and woody shrubs, mainly yaupon, American beautyberry, and dewberry (Rubus spp.), comprise 5 percent of the composition. Trees, consisting of either live oak or post oak, dominate the small mottes found on the site. An occasional American elm or hackberry may be found in the tree mix. Productivity is very high and litter accumulates covering approximately 60 to 75 percent. Crusting does not occur on the soil surface and bare ground is less than 10 percent. Native legumes occur in relatively high numbers. Continuous grazing with excessive livestock numbers has had a major impact on the vegetation. The reduction in grass volume also reduces the incidence of wildfires allowing woody seedlings to escape fire and grow large enough to become fire tolerant. Moreover, as overgrazing continues, the more palatable tallgrasses are replaced by less desirable grasses. Basal densities of grass species will decline as does ground litter. Bare ground increases, as does annual production of annual forbs. Soil erosion is not a problem due to the flatness of the landscape. Once the woody invaders to this site such as mesquite, huisache and/or McCartney Rose seedlings appear in small numbers, the window of opportunity to control these plants before they become a serious problem is only very few years. Once the threshold of 15 percent canopy cover is surpassed, control requires a significant amount of resources in time, energy and money to restore the grassland.

Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile. Runoff is low and erosion is negligible.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Prairie has very deep sandy soils on uplands. The sands are generally greater than 20 inches deep before reaching a sandy clay loam subsurface horizon.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained, very slowly to moderately rapidly permeable soils. The surface is typically loamy fine sand. Generally, the soils are taxonomically classified as Arenic, but other classifications may be present. The argillic horizon textures range from fine sandy loam to clay loam. Argillic horizons exhibit redoximorphic features and even include plinthite in some pedons. A perched water table on top of the argillic can result following periods of heavy rain events. Soils correlated to this site include: Cheetham, Fordtran, Garcitas, Milby, and Monaville.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a tall/midgrass prairie. It is a fire-maintained, bunchgrass prairie composed of primarily warm-season, tall and midgrasses with a few warm-season perennial forbs and cool-season grasses and forbs. Recurrent fire, primarily during the summers and periodic grazing by bison were natural processes, which maintained this plant community. Under continuous, heavy livestock grazing the taller, more palatable bunchgrasses such as big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, Florida paspalum, and switchgrass decrease and are replaced by mid and shortgrasses. Subsequently, with the resulting reduced fuel loads, fire frequency and intensity decreased. As the process continued, these plants were replaced by even less palatable, less productive midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Soil Features
Blacklands consist of very deep, moderately well to well drained, very slowly permeable, slightly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Soils correlated to this site include: Banquete, Contee, Laewest, Marcado, and Victoria.

Reference Community
The Reference Plant Community for the Blackland is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Composition of tallgrasses make up over 60 percent of annual production, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and associated grasses, forbs, shrubs and woody vines make up the remainder. Historically, bison grazing was intermittent, and fires were both frequent (3 to 8 years) and intense. Annual forbs occur in greater or lesser amounts in response to grazing intensity, fire, drought, or excessive precipitation. This prairie site was heavily grazed by large numbers of domestic livestock by the late 1800's. Overgrazing without rest was exacerbated by the introduction of barbed wire fencing and water development. Overgrazing resulted in reduced production of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrass and some midgrass species and reduction of fire frequency and intensity. Some mid and shortgrasses increased because of this overgrazing and eventually annual forbs and grasses.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
Blacklands consist of very deep, moderately well to well drained, very slowly permeable, slightly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Soils correlated to this site include: Banquete, Contee, Laewest, Marcado, and Victoria.

Reference Community
The Reference Plant Community for the Blackland is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Composition of tallgrasses make up over 60 percent of annual production, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and associated grasses, forbs, shrubs and woody vines make up the remainder. Historically, bison grazing was intermittent, and fires were both frequent (3 to 8 years) and intense. Annual forbs occur in greater or lesser amounts in response to grazing intensity, fire, drought, or excessive precipitation. This prairie site was heavily grazed by large numbers of domestic livestock by the late 1800's. Overgrazing without rest was exacerbated by the introduction of barbed wire fencing and water development. Overgrazing resulted in reduced production of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrass and some midgrass species and reduction of fire frequency and intensity. Some mid and shortgrasses increased because of this overgrazing and eventually annual forbs and grasses.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained, very slowly to moderately rapidly permeable soils. The surface is typically loamy fine sand. Generally, the soils are taxonomically classified as Arenic, but other classifications may be present. The argillic horizon textures range from fine sandy loam to clay loam.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a tall/midgrass prairie. It is a fire-maintained, bunchgrass prairie composed of primarily warm-season, tall and midgrasses with a few warm-season perennial forbs and cool-season grasses and forbs. Recurrent fire, primarily during the summers and periodic grazing by bison were natural processes, which maintained this plant community. Under continuous, heavy livestock grazing the taller, more palatable bunchgrasses such as big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, Florida paspalum, and switchgrass decrease and are replaced by mid and shortgrasses. Subsequently, with the resulting reduced fuel loads, fire frequency and intensity decreased. As the process continued, these plants were replaced by even less palatable, less productive midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs.

The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile. Runoff is low and erosion is negligible. Soils correlated to this site include: Addicks, Algoa, Anahuac, Chesterville, Cyfair, Hockley, Katy, Kemah, Labelle, Levac, Meaton, Mocarey, Mockley, Morey, Orcadia, Spindletop, Viterbo, Winnie, Wockley, and Yeaton.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
The Well Drained Bottomland ecological site has well drained soils in bottomlands found adjacent to waterways. The sandy and loamy soils drain water quickly from the site, but their proximity to flood-prone waterways creates a unique mixture of plant species. The plants are adapted to withstand flooding and dryness because of the rapid permeability.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, moderately well drained and well drained soils formed from sandy sediments and loamy alluvium. Hatliff and Voss are the representative series and are classified as a coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Fluventic Dystrudept and a mixed, thermic, Oxyaquic Udipsamment, respectively. As with soils that are entisols and inceptisols, extensive horizon development has not occurred. The horizons are generally separated by a change in color as their textures are similar throughout the entire profile. The subsurface is saturated for at least 20 consecutive days, or 30 cumulative days throughout the year.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine and American beech. Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and water oak (Quercus nigra) are common and an occasional swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii) will be mixed in. Shrub species can vary, but American hornbeam is prolific, with eastern baccharis (Baccharis halimifolia) and witchhazel (Hamamelis virginiana) mixed in. Since the overstory canopy is somewhat closed, grass and forb species can be sparse. Thick stands of switchcane and broadleaf uniola will be present nearest the waterway where more sunlight exists. These species also stabilize the soil with their roots.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Deep Sands are characterized by soils with sandy upper horizons deeper than 50 inches.

Soil Features
The site is very deep, moderately well to somewhat excessively drained, and moderately to rapidly permeable sands. Soil reaction is moderately acid to neutral. Solum thickness is more than 80 inches. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and low on 3 to 5 percent slopes. Soils correlated to this site include: Kenney, Kuy, and Rupley.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for the Deep Sand Site is a Tall/Midgrass Savannah Community (1.1) with a less than 15 percent canopy of primarily live oak trees. Tallgrasses most likely made up over 60 percent of herbaceous production, followed by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. Dominant tallgrasses included big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, and switchgrass. Midgrasses such as little bluestem, Texasgrass, crinkleawn, and Pan American balsamscale made up a significant portion of the herbaceous composition. Perennial forbs such as prairie clover, sensitive briar, and woollywhite are important contributors. Annual forbs occur differing amounts in response to grazing intensity, fire, drought, or excessive precipitation. This savannah site was periodically heavily grazed by bison and both wild and domestic livestock. Continuous heavy grazing came with the advent of barbed wire and windmills in the mid to late 1800's. Overgrazing initially resulted in the reduction and then loss of the tallgrass component, creating loss of total biomass, reduced litter accumulations and reduction of fire frequency and intensity. If overgrazing continues, midgrasses replace tallgrasses, and some shortgrasses and annual forbs begin to dominate the community resulting in the Mid/Shortgrass Savannah Community (1.2).

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Prairie has very deep sandy soils on uplands. The sands are generally greater than 20 inches deep before reaching a sandy clay loam subsurface horizon.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained, very slowly to moderately rapidly permeable soils. The surface is typically loamy fine sand. Generally, the soils are taxonomically classified as Arenic, but other classifications may be present. The argillic horizon textures range from fine sandy loam to clay loam. Argillic horizons exhibit redoximorphic features and even include plinthite in some pedons. A perched water table on top of the argillic can result following periods of heavy rain events. Soils correlated to this site include: Cheetham, Fordtran, Garcitas, Milby, and Monaville.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a tall/midgrass prairie. It is a fire-maintained, bunchgrass prairie composed of primarily warm-season, tall and midgrasses with a few warm-season perennial forbs and cool-season grasses and forbs. Recurrent fire, primarily during the summers and periodic grazing by bison were natural processes, which maintained this plant community. Under continuous, heavy livestock grazing the taller, more palatable bunchgrasses such as big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, Florida paspalum, and switchgrass decrease and are replaced by mid and shortgrasses. Subsequently, with the resulting reduced fuel loads, fire frequency and intensity decreased. As the process continued, these plants were replaced by even less palatable, less productive midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Bottomland site is very deep with clay surface textures occurring on flood plains. The areas can be flooded and ponded for lengthy durations throughout the year.

Soil Features
The soils are poorly drained to moderately well drained and very deep. Permeability is very slow. The surface texture is typically clay. Soil reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Diagnostic features and horizons include a mollic epipedon, cambic horizon, and vertic features. Soils correlated to this site include: Brazoria, Chicolete, Churnabog, Ganado, Navaca, and Pledger.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for the Deep Sand Site is a Tall/Midgrass Savannah Community (1.1) with a less than 15 percent canopy of primarily live oak trees. Tallgrasses most likely made up over 60 percent of herbaceous production, followed by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. Dominant tallgrasses included big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, and switchgrass. Midgrasses such as little bluestem, Texasgrass, crinkleawn, and Pan American balsamscale made up a significant portion of the herbaceous composition. Perennial forbs such as prairie clover, sensitive briar, and woollywhite are important contributors. Annual forbs occur differing amounts in response to grazing intensity, fire, drought, or excessive precipitation. This savannah site was periodically heavily grazed by bison and both wild and domestic livestock. Continuous heavy grazing came with the advent of barbed wire and windmills in the mid to late 1800's. Overgrazing initially resulted in the reduction and then loss of the tallgrass component, creating loss of total biomass, reduced litter accumulations and reduction of fire frequency and intensity. If overgrazing continues, midgrasses replace tallgrasses, and some shortgrasses and annual forbs begin to dominate the community resulting in the Mid/Shortgrass Savannah Community (1.2).

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam ecological site typically has a fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam surface. Sandy clay loam subsoil horizons are generally present 15 to 18 inches below the surface.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, moderately well or well drained, with very slow or slow permeability. Other features consist of moderately acid to neutral soil reaction. The dominant surface texture is fine sandy loam with some inclusions of loamy fine sand. Diagnostic features and horizons include an ochric epipedon and argillic horizon. A representative ochric epipedon ranges from 5 to 10 inches thick. Some pedons exhibit vertic properties in the argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Blanconia, Copano, Fulshear, Inez, and Morales.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent grassland composed primarily of tallgrasses and midgrasses that make up to 70 percent of the composition. Forbs make up 5 percent of the composition and woody shrubs, mainly yaupon, American beautyberry, and dewberry (Rubus spp.), comprise 5 percent of the composition. Trees, consisting of either live oak or post oak, dominate the small mottes found on the site. An occasional American elm or hackberry may be found in the tree mix. Productivity is very high and litter accumulates covering approximately 60 to 75 percent. Crusting does not occur on the soil surface and bare ground is less than 10 percent. Native legumes occur in relatively high numbers. Continuous grazing with excessive livestock numbers has had a major impact on the vegetation. The reduction in grass volume also reduces the incidence of wildfires allowing woody seedlings to escape fire and grow large enough to become fire tolerant. Moreover, as overgrazing continues, the more palatable tallgrasses are replaced by less desirable grasses. Basal densities of grass species will decline as does ground litter. Bare ground increases, as does annual production of annual forbs. Soil erosion is not a problem due to the flatness of the landscape. Once the woody invaders to this site such as mesquite, huisache and/or McCartney Rose seedlings appear in small numbers, the window of opportunity to control these plants before they become a serious problem is only very few years. Once the threshold of 15 percent canopy cover is surpassed, control requires a significant amount of resources in time, energy and money to restore the grassland.

The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Bottomland site is very deep with clay surface textures occurring on flood plains. The areas can be flooded and ponded for lengthy durations throughout the year.

Soil Features
The soils are poorly drained to moderately well drained and very deep. Permeability is very slow. The surface texture is typically clay. Soil reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Diagnostic features and horizons include a mollic epipedon, cambic horizon, and vertic features. Soils correlated to this site include: Brazoria, Chicolete, Churnabog, Ganado, Navaca, and Pledger.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
Blacklands consist of very deep, moderately well to well drained, very slowly permeable, slightly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Soils correlated to this site include: Banquete, Contee, Laewest, Marcado, and Victoria.

Reference Community
The Reference Plant Community for the Blackland is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Composition of tallgrasses make up over 60 percent of annual production, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and associated grasses, forbs, shrubs and woody vines make up the remainder. Historically, bison grazing was intermittent, and fires were both frequent (3 to 8 years) and intense. Annual forbs occur in greater or lesser amounts in response to grazing intensity, fire, drought, or excessive precipitation. This prairie site was heavily grazed by large numbers of domestic livestock by the late 1800's. Overgrazing without rest was exacerbated by the introduction of barbed wire fencing and water development. Overgrazing resulted in reduced production of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrass and some midgrass species and reduction of fire frequency and intensity. Some mid and shortgrasses increased because of this overgrazing and eventually annual forbs and grasses.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
Blacklands consist of very deep, moderately well to well drained, very slowly permeable, slightly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Soils correlated to this site include: Banquete, Contee, Laewest, Marcado, and Victoria.

Reference Community
The Reference Plant Community for the Blackland is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Composition of tallgrasses make up over 60 percent of annual production, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and associated grasses, forbs, shrubs and woody vines make up the remainder. Historically, bison grazing was intermittent, and fires were both frequent (3 to 8 years) and intense. Annual forbs occur in greater or lesser amounts in response to grazing intensity, fire, drought, or excessive precipitation. This prairie site was heavily grazed by large numbers of domestic livestock by the late 1800's. Overgrazing without rest was exacerbated by the introduction of barbed wire fencing and water development. Overgrazing resulted in reduced production of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrass and some midgrass species and reduction of fire frequency and intensity. Some mid and shortgrasses increased because of this overgrazing and eventually annual forbs and grasses.

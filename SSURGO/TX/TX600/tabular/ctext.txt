Ecological Site Concept
The Terrace ecological site has very deep soils on terrace landforms. These sites are located on a higher landform than bottomlands and are not as wet. The sites are situated on a lower landform than the uplands and are not as dry. The sites do not flood or pond. This unique position between the drier uplands and wetter bottomlands creates their plant community.

Soil Features
Alazan, Attoyac, and Bernaldo are representative soils of the Terraces. The Terraces can have a wide range of textures and depths. The grouping factor is, all are located on the terrace landform position.

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The ecological site is associated with deep, well-drained, moderately rapidly-permeable soils on uplands. Surface soils range from loamy sands, sandy loams, or loams. The clay increase is gradual throughout the soil profile. The profile typically transitions from a sandy/loamy surface to a sandy loam or sandy clay loam subsurface.

Longleaf pine trees comprise the majority of the overstory. The occurrence in the overstory on any given site is between 75 to 100 percent. Blackjack and post oaks have established on some sites, each ranging from 0 to 10 percent of the overall canopy structure. Shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) will be found in lesser amounts, usually less than 5 percent. Farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), sassafras (Sassafras albidium), and oak saplings are common in the mid-story layer (4.5 to 13 feet), although overall presence in the system is quite low (0 to 10 percent). Both communities are characterized by a diverse ground layer with minor patches of bare ground and litter (5 to 15 percent and 10 to 30 percent, respectively). Little bluestem and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are the most abundant grasses seen in the two communities.

Ecological Site Concept
The Poorly Drained Loamy Upland ecological site has very deep, poorly drained soils. The poor drainage pattern causes water to persist for long periods of time after precipitation events. The resulting hydrophytic plant communities are able to withstand the presence of water.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly to very poorly drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative series are Bissonnet, Caddo, Camptown, Evadale, Jasco, Kinder, Olive, Sorter, Tyden, and Waller. Since so many soils belong to this ecological site, their taxonomies vary, but all belong to the orders of alfisols and ultisols. The soils extend throughout the whole region and are widely prolific.

The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine, with longleaf pine as a co-dominant. Other species such as sweetgum (Liquidambar straciflua), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica) may be present, but not in large numbers. The midstory and understory vary significantly, especially with time since last fire. An herbaceous understory will be found directly after a burn and more shrub species will be present as the time since fire lengthens. Common midstory shrubs and trees include wax myrtle (Morella cerifera), dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and redbay (Persea borbonia). Understory species include a variety of sedges (Carex sp.), flatsedges (Cyperus sp.), rushes (Juncus sp.), spikerushes (Eleocharis sp.), and fimbry (Fimbristylis sp.). The presence of spikerushes is oftentimes an indicator of the site. Lizards tail (Saururus cernuus) is the most prolific forb species.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile. Runoff is low and erosion is negligible. Soils correlated to this site include: Addicks, Algoa, Anahuac, Chesterville, Cyfair, Hockley, Katy, Kemah, Labelle, Levac, Meaton, Mocarey, Mockley, Morey, Orcadia, Spindletop, Viterbo, Winnie, Wockley, and Yeaton.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Savannah ecological site is characterized by a fine sandy loam surface soil underlain by a dense clay subsoil. This is also the typifying site to which the MLRA derived it's name. The clay subsoil impacts water movement through the soil, which often perches water.

Soil Features
The soils are shallow to very deep and typically have fine sandy loam surfaces and dense clay subsoil. The fine sandy loam topsoil ranges from 6 to 15 inches deep but averages less than 10 inches. The surface soil takes in water readily but the clay subsoil is very slowly permeable and restricts air movement and root growth. The very slow permeability and shallow topsoil cause the site to be wet in the winter, slow to warm in the spring, and droughty during the growing season. Low to moderate fertility somewhat limits production on this site. Under good management where herbaceous cover and litter are maintained, rills, gullies, pedestals, and soil compaction layers are not present on the site.

Reference Community
The interpretive plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is a fire-climax savannah of post oak and blackjack oak trees that shade 15 to 20 percent of the ground. The herbaceous component is tall and midgrasses dominated by little bluestem, Indiangrass, and brownseed paspalum (Paspalum plicatulum), which usually make up 50 to 75 percent of the total annual yield. Purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus), Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum), switchgrass, tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), and thin paspalum (Paspalum setaceum) also occur. Cool-season forage plants occurring on this site include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Engelmann's daisy, and sedges (Carex spp.). A variety of shrubs, vines, and forbs occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the herbaceous plant community and the savannah landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing or over rest and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species such as eastern persimmon, eastern red cedar, and winged elm. Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to the Shrubland State.

Ecological Site Concept
""The Claypan Prairie is a true tallgrass prairie. The soils are characterized by loamy surface soils underlain by dense, hard, clays. This \claypan\"""" restricts air and water movements, as well as root penetration.""""""

Soil Features
The site consists of moderately deep to deep, moderately well to well drained soils that have slow to very slow permeability. The upland soils formed in calcareous weathered shale and the terraces formed in clayey alluvial sediments. In a representative profile, the surface layer is dark brown fine sandy loam about eight inches thick. Below 8 inches and to depths of more than 40 inches, the subsoil is clay that grades from brown to olive as depth increases. The subsoil commonly contains pale yellow and light brownish gray mottles as well as calcium carbonate masses. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is moderate and the shrink-swell potential can be a limitation. The Claypan Prairie soils can be highly productive for improved pasture or rangeland however, when dry, the surface layer of these soils can be massive and hard. The site is used primarily for improved pasture or rangeland, however, a few small areas are used for cropland. The dominant associated soil series include: Bazette, Bremond, Crockett, Davilla, Ivanhoe, Mabank, Navo, Normangee, Parisian, Payne, Ponder, Rader, and Wilson.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is the reference community. It is characterized by deeper soils underlain at rather shallow depths by dense, hard, clayey material. This ""claypan"" restricts air and water movements, as well as root penetration. This site is dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, five percent or less. Little bluestem dominates the site. Indiangrass, big bluestem, and switchgrass act as decreasers on this site and are the first species to be removed by improper grazing management. Other important grasses include Virginia wildrye, Canada wildrye (Elymus Canadensis), and Florida paspalum. Important midgrasses include sideoats grama, hairy dropseed (Sporobolus compositus var. drummondii), silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), and Texas wintergrass. Forbs commonly found on the site include: Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), scurfpea (Psoralidium), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include species of oak, elm (Ulmus spp.), hackberry, coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus), and bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.). The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (e.g., switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition. Forbs, particularly less palatable species, will increase at this stage. This site can have dramatic increases in forbs, particularly following a fire. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Infiltration is moderate and runoff is very low when the soils are dry and open. However, once soils have sealed shut, infiltration is slow and runoff may be rapid. Soils are high in organic matter and the heavy plant cover contributes to increasing organic matter and soil building.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Savannah ecological site is characterized by a fine sandy loam surface soil underlain by a dense clay subsoil. This is also the typifying site to which the MLRA derived it's name. The clay subsoil impacts water movement through the soil, which often perches water.

Soil Features
The soils are shallow to very deep and typically have fine sandy loam surfaces and dense clay subsoil. The fine sandy loam topsoil ranges from 6 to 15 inches deep but averages less than 10 inches. The surface soil takes in water readily but the clay subsoil is very slowly permeable and restricts air movement and root growth. The very slow permeability and shallow topsoil cause the site to be wet in the winter, slow to warm in the spring, and droughty during the growing season. Low to moderate fertility somewhat limits production on this site. Under good management where herbaceous cover and litter are maintained, rills, gullies, pedestals, and soil compaction layers are not present on the site. Soils correlated to this site include: Arol, Axtell, Boonville, Burlewash, Cadell, Crockett, Darst, Derly, Edge, Falba, Gredge, Kurten, Lufkin, Mabank, Normangee, Rader, Rutersville, Sarco, Shalba, Singleton, Straber, Tabor, Winedale, Zack, and Zulch.

Reference Community
The interpretive plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is a fire-climax savannah of post oak and blackjack oak trees that shade 15 to 20 percent of the ground. The herbaceous component is tall and midgrasses dominated by little bluestem, Indiangrass, and brownseed paspalum (Paspalum plicatulum), which usually make up 50 to 75 percent of the total annual yield. Purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus), Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum), switchgrass, tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), and thin paspalum (Paspalum setaceum) also occur. Cool-season forage plants occurring on this site include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Engelmann's daisy, and sedges (Carex spp.). A variety of shrubs, vines, and forbs occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the herbaceous plant community and the savannah landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing or over rest and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species such as eastern persimmon, eastern red cedar, and winged elm.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Bottomlands have that soils are very deep loams and are associated with flooding regimes. The loamy-textured soils allow the water to drain faster than the Clayey Bottomlands, and therefore do not stay inundated as long.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep, loamy-textured, and moderately permeable. They usually receive extra water as overflow from watercourses or as runoff from adjacent higher sites. They are, however, better drained than the clayey bottomland sites. The plant-soil-water-air relationship is very favorable for plant growth. These factors, together with the natural fertility of the soil, favor high yields of good quality forage. Soils correlated to this site include: Bosque, Coarsewood, Gowen, Gowker, Hatliff, Highbank, Kanebreak, Nahatche, and Whitesboro.

Reference Community
The reference plant community of this site is a savannah. Oak, elm, hackberry, cottonwood, ash, black willow (Salix nigra), pecan, and other large trees provide about a 40 percent canopy. The overstory canopy is denser immediately adjacent to the watercourse. The understory may include hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), greenbriar (Smilax spp.), Alabama supplejack (Berchemia scandens), peppervine (Ampelopsis arborea), grape (Vitis spp.), trumpet creeper (Parthenocissus spp.) and honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica). Sedges, Virginia wildrye, switchcane, broadleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium latifolium), and rustyseed paspalum (Paspalum langei) in shaded and wet areas dominate the herbaceous plant community. Various combinations of beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), switchgrass, Indiangrass, big (Andropogon gerardii) and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), eastern gamagrass, vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum) may dominate drier, open areas. Continuous yearlong grazing for a succession of years will tend to move the reference herbaceous plant community towards a herbaceous community of common Bermudagrass, dallisgrass, Vasey's grass (Paspalum urvillei), carpetgrass, giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), and annual sumpweed (Iva annua). Prescribed grazing may shift this herbaceous community back towards the reference herbaceous species. Continuous yearlong grazing with no weed or brush management or abandoning the site for several years will tend to move towards a shrub-sapling community. Once woody shrubs and saplings invade the site, brush management in some form must be used to move back toward the savannah state. Prescribed burning is not a viable management tool on this site due to excess fine fuel moisture.

Ecological Site Concept
The Poorly Drained Loamy Upland ecological site has very deep, poorly drained soils. The poor drainage pattern causes water to persist for long periods of time after precipitation events. The resulting hydrophytic plant communities are able to withstand the presence of water.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly to very poorly drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative series are Bissonnet, Caddo, Camptown, Evadale, Jasco, Kinder, Olive, Sorter, Tyden, and Waller. Since so many soils belong to this ecological site, their taxonomies vary, but all belong to the orders of alfisols and ultisols. The soils extend throughout the whole region and are widely prolific.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine, with longleaf pine as a co-dominant. Other species such as sweetgum (Liquidambar straciflua), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica) may be present, but not in large numbers. The midstory and understory vary significantly, especially with time since last fire. An herbaceous understory will be found directly after a burn and more shrub species will be present as the time since fire lengthens. Common midstory shrubs and trees include wax myrtle (Morella cerifera), dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and redbay (Persea borbonia). Understory species include a variety of sedges (Carex sp.), flatsedges (Cyperus sp.), rushes (Juncus sp.), spikerushes (Eleocharis sp.), and fimbry (Fimbristylis sp.).

Ecological Site Concept
The Well Drained Loamy Upland ecological site has very deep loamy, well to moderately well drained soils. These sites have the highest potential for producing biomass across the area. They support high quality stands of timber and dense stands of herbaceous vegetation.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, well to moderately well drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative soils series are Atasco, Boy, Buna, Craigen, Dallardsville, Gist, Kountze, Messer, Niwana, Otanya, Segno, Silsbee, Tarkington, and Westcott. The soils range in taxonomic classification, but belong to the soil orders of alfisols and ultisols. The soils are expansive across the region and provide the best medium for growing plants with little to any restrictions.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by longleaf pine. An occasional southern red oak (Quercus falcata) or post oak (Quercus stellata) may be seen, but not enough to be considered co-dominants. The midstory is dependent on time since last fire. Areas with recent burns will have less midstory shrubs present. Indicator shrubs are flameleaf sumac (Rhus copallinum) and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum). Other shrubs present will be American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria). Tall grass species are dominant on the site. Little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) will be the most common, but indicator species are big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). The understory is diverse in forbs as well. Purple coneflower (Echinacea sp.), flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), gayfeathers (Liatris sp.), and Texas ironweed (Veronia texana) are common.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei).

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age.

Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clay Loam ecological site is characterized by their shallow to very deep soils with clay loam textures.

Soil Features
These upland soils are deep and dark brown to grayish brown in the surface. They are fertile and able to store large amounts of water to make this a productive site. Air, water, and plant roots move through these soils easily. Soils correlated to this site include: Benchley, Brenham, Carbengle, Cuero, Davilla, Klump, Knolle, Krum, and Schulenburg.

Reference Community
The characteristic plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is a true prairie with a few large post oak, elm, and hackberry trees along the draws and in occasional mottes. Little bluestem dominates the plant community, making up 40 to 50 percent of the total annual yield. Indiangrass and big bluestem make up another 30 percent. Numerous other grasses occur in the potential plant community but less frequently and in smaller amounts. Texas wintergrass and Canada wildrye (Elymus Canadensis) are perennial cool season plants that occur on the site. A variety of forbs, including Illinois bundleflower, Maximilian sunflower, Engelmann's daisy, and black Sampson (Echinacea angustifolia) occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the reference plant community and the prairie landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing, or over-rest, and the absence of fire tend to favor a vegetative shift towards woody species such as post oak, mesquite, elm, hackberry, and cedar. Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to a shrub-dominated community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie. Reference sites show an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are moderately deep to very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
The site consists of moderately deep to very deep, moderately well to well drained soils that are slow to very slowly permeable. The upland soils formed in calcareous marl and marine sediments, high in smectitic clays. The terrace soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments. A few of the upland soils may have weathered and soft bedrock at a depth of more than 24 inches below the soil surface. The majority of this site is used for cropland due to the very deep, highly productive soils. There are some areas that are used for pasture or rangeland. In a representative profile, the surface layer is black clay about 24 inches thick. The clay extends below 24 inches and to depths of more than 80 inches. The subsoil is clay that grades from very dark gray to light olive brown as depth increases. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is moderate, and shrink swell potential is very high. The dominant associated soil series for the Blackland ecological site includes: Barbosa, Behring, Branyon, Burleson, Chatt, Dalco, Deport, Fairlie, Ferris, Heiden, Houston Black, and Leson.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Plant Community (1.1) is the reference community. It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, five percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years). Indiangrass, big bluestem, eastern gamagrass, and switchgrass dominate the site. Little bluestem and Florida paspalum act as increasers when improper grazing management causes less grazing tolerant grasses to lose vigor. Other important grasses included Virginia wildrye, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), button snakeroot (Eryngium yuccifolium), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical but infrequent shrub and tree species include species of oak, hackberry, and elm (Ulmus spp.), along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (e.g. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and Florida paspalum. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Grassland State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 35 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Shrubland State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between community and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. Species composition by weight remains an important descriptor of the herbaceous community and of the community as a whole. Woody species are included in species composition for the site. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Infiltration is rapid and runoff is very low when the soils are dry and open. Once soils have swelled to the point of sealing shut, infiltration is slow and runoff can occur. Soils with heavy plant cover contribute to increasing organic matter and soil building. The nearly level areas have gilgai. Sloping soils also have gilgai which create microridges and valleys extending up and down the slopes. Soil erosion is very low if tallgrasses and the water trapping gilgai are present. As much as six inches of water could be temporarily trapped in these gilgai microreliefs before runoff begins. Plowing removes the gilgai; it may take 20 years or more after plowing stops for the gilgai to reform.

Ecological Site Concept
""The Claypan Prairie is characterized by loamy surface soils underlain by dense, hard clays. This \claypan\"""" restricts air and water movements, as well as root penetration.""""""

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep, noncalcareous sandy loams and clay loams. The topsoil is underlain at rather shallow depths by dense, hard, clayey material which restricts air, water movement, and root growth. The soils take in water slowly, but can hold large amounts of water and plant nutrients. The soils of this site give up water grudgingly to growing plants. Plants may wilt even though the soil has a comparatively high moisture content. Heavy surface crusts develop in the absence of good vegetative cover. Soils correlated to the site include: Axtell, Bremond, Crockett, Hallettsville, Mabank, Normangee, and Wilson.

Reference Community
The reference plant community of this site is a prairie or very open savannah. Live oak (Quercus virginiana), winged elm, or hackberry may occur along water courses or in scattered mottes and provide 5 to 10 percent canopy cover. Large, old post oak trees may be widely scattered over this site. The herbaceous plant community is dominated by little bluestem and Indiangrass which usually constitutes 50 to 65 percent of the total annual yield. Switchgrass, big bluestem, Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), silver bluestem, and tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus) are important components of the warm season grass population. Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), and Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha) are components of the cool season grass population. Important forbs include Engelmann's daisy, gayfeather (Liatris spp.), bundleflower, prairie petunia (Ruellia humilis), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the reference plant community and the prairie landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing, or over-rest, and the absence of fire tend to favor a vegetative shift towards woody species such as mesquite, elm, hackberry, post oak, persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), and honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos). Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to the Oak/Mesquite/Midgrass Savannah Community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Chalky Ridge sites are characterized by their shallow soils on ridges with high concentrations of chalk, or calcium carbonates.

Soil Features
The soils are dark brown to brownish-gray calcareous clay loams. The surface soil, usually low in organic matter, is underlain by strongly cemented, calcareous sandstone at depths of 11 to 15 inches. The shallow soils severely limit moisture and fertility holding capacity. Roots readily penetrate the parent material, but moisture and minerals are generally not sufficient to support dense stands of high producing grasses. Surface compaction is common. Runoff is high and erosion is a problem when the soil is bare. Renish is the only soil correlated with this site.

Reference Community
The reference plant community of this site is a prairie or very open savannah sparsely covered with single live oak, hackberry, or bumelia trees, or scattered woody mottes that provide 10 percent or less canopy. The scattered trees, tall native grasses, colorful wildflowers, and rolling topography make this an attractive site. The herbaceous plant community is dominated by little bluestem which generally produces 50 to 75 percent of the total annual production. Indiangrass, big bluestem, sideoats grama, and meadow dropseed are important components of the warm season grass population. Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), and Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha) are components of the cool season grass population.

Ecological Site Concept
The Chalky Ridge sites are characterized by their shallow soils on ridges with high concentrations of chalk, or calcium carbonates.

Soil Features
The soils are dark brown to brownish-gray calcareous clay loams. The surface soil, usually low in organic matter, is underlain by strongly cemented, calcareous sandstone at depths of 11 to 15 inches. The shallow soils severely limit moisture and fertility holding capacity. Roots readily penetrate the parent material, but moisture and minerals are generally not sufficient to support dense stands of high producing grasses. Surface compaction is common. Runoff is high and erosion is a problem when the soil is bare. Renish is the only soil correlated with this site.

Reference Community
The reference plant community of this site is a prairie or very open savannah sparsely covered with single live oak, hackberry, or bumelia trees, or scattered woody mottes that provide 10 percent or less canopy. The scattered trees, tall native grasses, colorful wildflowers, and rolling topography make this an attractive site. The herbaceous plant community is dominated by little bluestem which generally produces 50 to 75 percent of the total annual production. Indiangrass, big bluestem, sideoats grama, and meadow dropseed are important components of the warm season grass population. Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), and Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha) are components of the cool season grass population. Important forbs include gayfeather, Maximillian sunflower (Helianthus maximilliani), Engelmann's daisy, cobea penstemon, black samson, blue sage (Salvia azurea), compass plant (Silphium sp.), bundleflower, and western indigo. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the reference plant community and the prairie landscape structure. Continuous over grazing, or over rest, and the absence of fire tend to favor a transition towards a community dominated by hackberry, prickly pear (Opuntia sp.), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), threeawn (Aristida sp.), Texas wintergrass, and annual broomweed (Amphiachyris amoena). Without corrective grazing management and burning, the transition will continue to a woodland state dominated by cedar, bumelia, elm, and hackberry.

Ecological Site Concept
The site is characterized by very deep soils with a sand layer that extends at least 40 inches into the subsoil before any noticeable clay accumulations. This causes the site to be droughty, but more productive than the Very Deep Sand ecological site.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are very deep, rapidly permeable, neutral to slightly acid fine sands. Most are classified as grossarenic, meaning the sand continues to a depth of 40 inches until a noticable amount of clay increases in the subsoil. Moisture enters the soil rapidly, and quickly passes through and out of the root zone. Moisture holding capacity and inherent fertility is low. Water erosion is generally not a hazard but the site is susceptible to wind erosion when the soil is exposed. The site is subject to erosion where adequate herbaceous cover is not maintained and on heavy use areas such as roads and livestock trails. Soils correlated to this site include: Aluf, Arenosa, Catilla, Desan, Eufaula, Faula, Hitilo, Joiner, Navasan, Padina, Patilo, Tadina, and Tonkavar.

Reference Community
The characteristic plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is an open savannah of bluejack oak (Quercus incana), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), and post oak (Quercus stellata) trees that shade up to 25 percent of the ground. The dominant understory shrubs include yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), and American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana). The herbaceous plant community of tall and midgrasses is dominated by little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) which makes up 50 to 65 percent of the total annual production. Sand lovegrass (Eragrostis trichodes), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), and purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus) occur less frequently and in smaller amounts. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every five to seven years are important in the maintenance of the reference plant community and the savannah landscape structure.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam site are upland sites with sandy surface soils over loamy subsoils. The surface soils are usually less than 10 inches deep. The site is one of most vegetatively productive uplands sites in the MLRA.

Soil Features
The soils are moderately deep to very deep fine sandy loams and loamy fine sands with a minimum thickness of 10 inches. The sandy surface is underlain by clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam subsoil. Moisture from light showers is readily absorbed by the surface soil, and the subsoil takes in water moderately well. Fertility and water holding capacity are moderate in the surface and high in the subsoil. Air, water, and plant roots move through the soil readily. The soils give up water generously to growing plants. Surface crusts, slower water intake, and increased runoff are characteristics of the soils in a deteriorated condition.

Purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus), Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum), switchgrass, tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), and thin paspalum (Paspalum setaceum) also occur. Cool season plants occuring on the site include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia pinnatifida), and sedges (Carex spp.). A variety of shrubs, vines, and forbs occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the reference herbaceous plant community and the savannah landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing, over rest, and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species such as eastern persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), and winged elm (Ulmus alata).

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Ecological Site Concept
""The Claypan Prairie is characterized by loamy surface soils underlain by dense, hard clays. This \claypan\"""" restricts air and water movements, as well as root penetration.""""""

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep, noncalcareous sandy loams and clay loams. The topsoil is underlain at rather shallow depths by dense, hard, clayey material which restricts air, water movement, and root growth. The soils take in water slowly, but can hold large amounts of water and plant nutrients. The soils of this site give up water grudgingly to growing plants. Plants may wilt even though the soil has a comparatively high moisture content. Heavy surface crusts develop in the absence of good vegetative cover. Soils correlated to the site include: Axtell, Bremond, Crockett, Hallettsville, Mabank, Normangee, and Wilson.

Reference Community
The reference plant community of this site is a prairie or very open savannah. Live oak (Quercus virginiana), winged elm, or hackberry may occur along water courses or in scattered mottes and provide 5 to 10 percent canopy cover. Large, old post oak trees may be widely scattered over this site. The herbaceous plant community is dominated by little bluestem and Indiangrass which usually constitutes 50 to 65 percent of the total annual yield. Switchgrass, big bluestem, Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), silver bluestem, and tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus) are important components of the warm season grass population. Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), and Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha) are components of the cool season grass population. Important forbs include Engelmann's daisy, gayfeather (Liatris spp.), bundleflower, prairie petunia (Ruellia humilis), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the reference plant community and the prairie landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing, or over-rest, and the absence of fire tend to favor a vegetative shift towards woody species such as mesquite, elm, hackberry, post oak, persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), and honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos). Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to the Oak/Mesquite/Midgrass Savannah Community.

Ecological Site Concept
The sites are characterized by a sandy surface layer that extends 20 to 40 inches to a loamy subsurface layer. The sites are more productive and less droughty than soils with deeper sands, but not as productive as soils with a higher clay content.

Soil Features
The soils are deep to very deep, fine sands and loamy fine sands with a surface 20 to 40 inches thick over loamy subsoils. Water soaks rapidly into the open soils. Even light showers penetrate below the evaporation zone and are more effective on this site than sites with deeper sands. Water retention is relatively low but the soils give up a high percent of their moisture to growing plants. Although air, water, and plant roots move through the soil with ease, frequent rains are needed to produce optimum plant growth. Inherent low fertility causes these soils to produce forage of lower quantity than associated sites with higher clay content. The site is subject to erosion where adequate herbaceous cover is not maintained and on heavy use areas such as roads and livestock trails. Soils correlated to this site include: Demona, Dutek, Newulm, Nimrod, Rehburg, Robco, Silstid, and Styx.

Reference Community
The characteristic plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is an open savannah of post oak and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) trees that shade 20 to 25 percent of the ground. The herbaceous component is mid and tallgrasses and is dominated by little bluestem which usually makes up 50 to 75 percent of the total annual production. Indiangrass, purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus), switchgrass, beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), sand lovegrass (Eragrostis trichodes), brownseed paspalum (Paspalum plicatulum), and thin paspalum (Paspalum setaceum) also occur. Cool season forage plants are scarce on this site. A variety of shrubs, vines, and forbs occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every five to seven years are important in the maintenance of the reference herbaceous plant community and the savannah landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing or over rest and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species. Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to the Shrubland State.

Ecological Site Concept
The site is characterized by very deep soils with a sand layer that extends at least 40 inches into the subsoil before any noticeable clay accumulations. This causes the site to be droughty, but more productive than the Very Deep Sand ecological site.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are very deep, rapidly permeable, neutral to slightly acid fine sands. Most are classified as grossarenic, meaning the sand continues to a depth of 40 inches until a noticable amount of clay increases in the subsoil. Moisture enters the soil rapidly, and quickly passes through and out of the root zone. Moisture holding capacity and inherent fertility is low. Water erosion is generally not a hazard but the site is susceptible to wind erosion when the soil is exposed.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Community is dominated by warm-season perennial tallgrasses, particularly little bluestem. Other important grasses include: Indiangrass, big bluestem, switchgrass, vine mesquite (panicum obtusum), silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), and Texas wintergrass. Warm-season perennial midgrasses constitute most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season perennial forb component varies from 5 to 15 percent of the community composition depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Forbs commonly found include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), and halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus). Typical, but infrequent, shrub and tree species found in the reference community include species of bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.), hackberry, elm, and live oak. The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem, which will increase its dominance. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site is distinguished by its deep productive soils that are richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the region.

Soil Features
These soils are deep, dark colored to olive, slightly acid to calcareous clays. The soils have high shrink-swell properties often forming microdepressions and microknolls. When they are dry and cracked, they take in water rapidly. When they are wet and the cracks have closed, however, the water intake is slow. The soils hold large amounts of water and have high natural fertility. They seal over when cover is inadequate and erosion is then a hazard. The soils are sticky and plastic when wet. When moist, they are crumbly. Good soil structure is generally very evident under grass cover. In this condition, they favor air and water movement and root growth. Soils correlated to this site include: Bleiblerville, Branyon, Denhawken, Dimebox, Elmendorf, Frelsburg, Houston Black, and Luling.

Reference Community
The characteristic plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is a true prairie with few large live oak (Quercus virginiana), elm, and hackberry trees along the draws and in occasional motts. Little bluestem dominates the plant community, making up 40 to 50 percent of the total annual yield. Indiangrass and big bluestem make up another 30 percent. Numerous other grasses occur in the potential plant community but less frequently and in smaller amounts. Texas wintergrass and Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginiana) are perennial cool season plants that occur on the site. A variety of forbs, including Illinois bundleflower, Maximilian sunflower, Engelmann's daisy, and black sampson (Echinacea angustifolia) occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the reference plant community and the prairie landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing, or over-rest and the absence of fire, tend to favor a vegetative shift towards woody species such as mesquite, elm, hackberry, cedar, and locust (Gleditsia triacanthos). Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to a mesquite-shrub dominated community.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clay Loam ecological site is characterized by their shallow to very deep soils with clay loam textures.

Soil Features
These upland soils are deep and dark brown to grayish brown in the surface. They are fertile and able to store large amounts of water to make this a productive site. Air, water, and plant roots move through these soils easily. Soils correlated to this site include: Benchley, Brenham, Carbengle, Cuero, Davilla, Klump, Knolle, Krum, and Schulenburg.

Reference Community
The characteristic plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is a true prairie with a few large post oak, elm, and hackberry trees along the draws and in occasional mottes. Little bluestem dominates the plant community, making up 40 to 50 percent of the total annual yield. Indiangrass and big bluestem make up another 30 percent. Numerous other grasses occur in the potential plant community but less frequently and in smaller amounts. Texas wintergrass and Canada wildrye (Elymus Canadensis) are perennial cool season plants that occur on the site. A variety of forbs, including Illinois bundleflower, Maximilian sunflower, Engelmann's daisy, and black Sampson (Echinacea angustifolia) occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the reference plant community and the prairie landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing, or over-rest, and the absence of fire tend to favor a vegetative shift towards woody species such as post oak, mesquite, elm, hackberry, and cedar. Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to a shrub-dominated community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam ecological site typically has a fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam surface. Sandy clay loam subsoil horizons are generally present 15 to 18 inches below the surface.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, moderately well or well drained, with very slow or slow permeability. Other features consist of moderately acid to neutral soil reaction. The dominant surface texture is fine sandy loam with some inclusions of loamy fine sand. Diagnostic features and horizons include an ochric epipedon and argillic horizon. A representative ochric epipedon ranges from 5 to 10 inches thick. Some pedons exhibit vertic properties in the argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Blanconia, Copano, Fulshear, Inez, and Morales.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent grassland composed primarily of tallgrasses and midgrasses that make up to 70 percent of the composition. Forbs make up 5 percent of the composition and woody shrubs, mainly yaupon, American beautyberry, and dewberry (Rubus spp.), comprise 5 percent of the composition. Trees, consisting of either live oak or post oak, dominate the small mottes found on the site. An occasional American elm or hackberry may be found in the tree mix. Productivity is very high and litter accumulates covering approximately 60 to 75 percent. Crusting does not occur on the soil surface and bare ground is less than 10 percent. Native legumes occur in relatively high numbers. Continuous grazing with excessive livestock numbers has had a major impact on the vegetation. The reduction in grass volume also reduces the incidence of wildfires allowing woody seedlings to escape fire and grow large enough to become fire tolerant. Moreover, as overgrazing continues, the more palatable tallgrasses are replaced by less desirable grasses. Basal densities of grass species will decline as does ground litter. Bare ground increases, as does annual production of annual forbs. Soil erosion is not a problem due to the flatness of the landscape. Once the woody invaders to this site such as mesquite, huisache and/or McCartney Rose seedlings appear in small numbers, the window of opportunity to control these plants before they become a serious problem is only very few years. Once the threshold of 15 percent canopy cover is surpassed, control requires a significant amount of resources in time, energy and money to restore the grassland.

Ecological Site Concept
The Deep Sands are characterized by soils with sandy upper horizons deeper than 50 inches.

Soil Features
The site is very deep, moderately well to somewhat excessively drained, and moderately to rapidly permeable sands. Soil reaction is moderately acid to neutral. Solum thickness is more than 80 inches. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and low on 3 to 5 percent slopes. Soils correlated to this site include: Kenney, Kuy, and Rupley.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for the Deep Sand Site is a Tall/Midgrass Savannah Community (1.1) with a less than 15 percent canopy of primarily live oak trees. Tallgrasses most likely made up over 60 percent of herbaceous production, followed by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. Dominant tallgrasses included big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, and switchgrass. Midgrasses such as little bluestem, Texasgrass, crinkleawn, and Pan American balsamscale made up a significant portion of the herbaceous composition. Perennial forbs such as prairie clover, sensitive briar, and woollywhite are important contributors. Annual forbs occur differing amounts in response to grazing intensity, fire, drought, or excessive precipitation. This savannah site was periodically heavily grazed by bison and both wild and domestic livestock. Continuous heavy grazing came with the advent of barbed wire and windmills in the mid to late 1800's. Overgrazing initially resulted in the reduction and then loss of the tallgrass component, creating loss of total biomass, reduced litter accumulations and reduction of fire frequency and intensity. If overgrazing continues, midgrasses replace tallgrasses, and some shortgrasses and annual forbs begin to dominate the community resulting in the Mid/Shortgrass Savannah Community (1.2).

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
The Terrace ecological site has very deep soils on terrace landforms. These sites are located on a higher landform than bottomlands and are not as wet. The sites are situated on a lower landform than the uplands and are not as dry. The sites do not flood or pond. This unique position between the drier uplands and wetter bottomlands creates their plant community.

Soil Features
Alazan, Attoyac, and Bernaldo are representative soils of the Terraces. The Terraces can have a wide range of textures and depths. The grouping factor is, all are located on the terrace landform position.

Reference Community
Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The ecological site is associated with deep, well-drained, moderately rapidly-permeable soils on uplands. Surface soils range from loamy sands, sandy loams, or loams. The clay increase is gradual throughout the soil profile. The profile typically transitions from a sandy/loamy surface to a sandy loam or sandy clay loam subsurface.

Ecological Site Concept
The Well Drained Loamy Upland ecological site has very deep loamy, well to moderately well drained soils. These sites have the highest potential for producing biomass across the area. They support high quality stands of timber and dense stands of herbaceous vegetation.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, well to moderately well drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative soils series are Atasco, Boy, Buna, Craigen, Dallardsville, Gist, Kountze, Messer, Niwana, Otanya, Segno, Silsbee, Tarkington, and Westcott. The soils range in taxonomic classification, but belong to the soil orders of alfisols and ultisols. The soils are expansive across the region and provide the best medium for growing plants with little to any restrictions.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by longleaf pine. An occasional southern red oak (Quercus falcata) or post oak (Quercus stellata) may be seen, but not enough to be considered co-dominants. The midstory is dependent on time since last fire. Areas with recent burns will have less midstory shrubs present. Indicator shrubs are flameleaf sumac (Rhus copallinum) and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum). Other shrubs present will be American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria). Tall grass species are dominant on the site. Little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) will be the most common, but indicator species are big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum).

Ecological Site Concept
The Seasonally Wet Upland site is unique by its upland position on the landscape, while also having a seasonally high water table. Clay soils in the subhorizons cause water to stay in the profile for long periods of time, especially from November to May. Not only does the water table affect the plants, but many of the soils are shallow with their depth to bedrock as low as 16 inches.

Soil Features
The soils consist of shallow to very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils formed from mudstone residuum. The representative soils are: Alusa, Anacoco, Browndell, Colita, Corrigan, Elmina, Felker, Fetzer, Gomery, Kolin, Libuse, Lummus, Metcalf, Tiak, and Wiergate. They are widely varying taxonomically, from alfisols to ultisols to vertisols. Their unifying factor is their upland position with a fluctuating water table. Many of the soils have restrictions to bedrock, classifying them as shallow.

Reference Community
The varying degree of water availability and root restriction cause the understory sites to be highly variable. Common understory species include: longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), sedges (Carex sp.), partridgeberry (Mitchella repens), and Texas ironweed (Vernonia texana). Common shrub species include: American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshallii), and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles. The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam occurring between 20 and 40 inches continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Briley series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain sediments. The series is classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by their upper horizons of sands and presence of an argillic between 20 and 40 inches.

Ecological Site Concept
The Terrace ecological site has very deep soils on terrace landforms. These sites are located on a higher landform than bottomlands and are not as wet. The sites are situated on a lower landform than the uplands and are not as dry. The sites do not flood or pond. This unique position between the drier uplands and wetter bottomlands creates their plant community.

Soil Features
Alazan, Attoyac, and Bernaldo are representative soils of the Terraces. The Terraces can have a wide range of textures and depths. The grouping factor is, all are located on the terrace landform position. Besides the previously listed soils, these are correlated as well: Addielou, Annona, Austonio, Bearhead, Besner, Bistineau, Cadeville, Cart, Chireno, Eastham, Elysian, Erno, Forbing, Freestone, Gallime, Garner, Glenmora, Hallsbluff, Keiffer, Landman, Latch, Mckamie, Moten, Multey, Raino, Shatta, Spurger, Timpson, Vesey, Waskom, and Woden.

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult.

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles. The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam occurring between 20 and 40 inches continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Briley series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain sediments. The series is classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by their upper horizons of sands and presence of an argillic between 20 and 40 inches.

Ecological Site Concept
The Seasonally Wet Upland site is unique by its upland position on the landscape, while also having a seasonally high water table. Clay soils in the subhorizons cause water to stay in the profile for long periods of time, especially from November to May. Not only does the water table affect the plants, but many of the soils are shallow with their depth to bedrock as low as 16 inches.

Soil Features
The soils consist of shallow to very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils formed from mudstone residuum. The representative soils are: Alusa, Anacoco, Browndell, Colita, Corrigan, Elmina, Felker, Fetzer, Gomery, Kolin, Libuse, Lummus, Metcalf, Tiak, and Wiergate. They are widely varying taxonomically, from alfisols to ultisols to vertisols. Their unifying factor is their upland position with a fluctuating water table. Many of the soils have restrictions to bedrock, classifying them as shallow.

Reference Community
The varying degree of water availability and root restriction cause the understory sites to be highly variable. Common understory species include: longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), sedges (Carex sp.), partridgeberry (Mitchella repens), and Texas ironweed (Vernonia texana). Common shrub species include: American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshallii), and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Forbs commonly found include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), and halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus). Typical, but infrequent, shrub and tree species found in the reference community include species of bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.), hackberry, elm, and live oak. The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem, which will increase its dominance. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Savannah ecological site is characterized by a fine sandy loam surface soil underlain by a dense clay subsoil. This is also the typifying site to which the MLRA derived it's name. The clay subsoil impacts water movement through the soil, which often perches water.

Soil Features
The soils are shallow to very deep and typically have fine sandy loam surfaces and dense clay subsoil. The fine sandy loam topsoil ranges from 6 to 15 inches deep but averages less than 10 inches. The surface soil takes in water readily but the clay subsoil is very slowly permeable and restricts air movement and root growth. The very slow permeability and shallow topsoil cause the site to be wet in the winter, slow to warm in the spring, and droughty during the growing season. Low to moderate fertility somewhat limits production on this site. Under good management where herbaceous cover and litter are maintained, rills, gullies, pedestals, and soil compaction layers are not present on the site. Soils correlated to this site include: Arol, Axtell, Boonville, Burlewash, Cadell, Crockett, Darst, Derly, Edge, Falba, Gredge, Kurten, Lufkin, Mabank, Normangee, Rader, Rutersville, Sarco, Shalba, Singleton, Straber, Tabor, Winedale, Zack, and Zulch.

Reference Community
The interpretive plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is a fire-climax savannah of post oak and blackjack oak trees that shade 15 to 20 percent of the ground. The herbaceous component is tall and midgrasses dominated by little bluestem, Indiangrass, and brownseed paspalum (Paspalum plicatulum), which usually make up 50 to 75 percent of the total annual yield. Purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus), Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum), switchgrass, tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), and thin paspalum (Paspalum setaceum) also occur. Cool-season forage plants occurring on this site include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Engelmann's daisy, and sedges (Carex spp.). A variety of shrubs, vines, and forbs occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the herbaceous plant community and the savannah landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing or over rest and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species such as eastern persimmon, eastern red cedar, and winged elm. Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to the Shrubland State.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep, noncalcareous sandy loams and clay loams. The topsoil is underlain at rather shallow depths by dense, hard, clayey material which restricts air, water movement, and root growth. The soils take in water slowly, but can hold large amounts of water and plant nutrients. The soils of this site give up water grudgingly to growing plants. Plants may wilt even though the soil has a comparatively high moisture content. Heavy surface crusts develop in the absence of good vegetative cover.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief.

The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site shows an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, poorly drained to moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils. The surface color is black to very dark gray. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist. Undisturbed areas exhibit gilgai micro-relief. Disturbed areas may begin to re-form gilgai in as little as 5 years but may take 40 to 50 years to match undisturbed sites. Soils correlated to this site include: Bacliff, Beaumont, Bernard, China, Lake Charles, League, and Verland.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam ecological site typically has a fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam surface. Sandy clay loam subsoil horizons are generally present 15 to 18 inches below the surface.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, moderately well or well drained, with very slow or slow permeability. Other features consist of moderately acid to neutral soil reaction. The dominant surface texture is fine sandy loam with some inclusions of loamy fine sand. Diagnostic features and horizons include an ochric epipedon and argillic horizon. A representative ochric epipedon ranges from 5 to 10 inches thick. Some pedons exhibit vertic properties in the argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Blanconia, Copano, Fulshear, Inez, and Morales.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent grassland composed primarily of tallgrasses and midgrasses that make up to 70 percent of the composition. Forbs make up 5 percent of the composition and woody shrubs, mainly yaupon, American beautyberry, and dewberry (Rubus spp.), comprise 5 percent of the composition. Trees, consisting of either live oak or post oak, dominate the small mottes found on the site. An occasional American elm or hackberry may be found in the tree mix. Productivity is very high and litter accumulates covering approximately 60 to 75 percent. Crusting does not occur on the soil surface and bare ground is less than 10 percent. Native legumes occur in relatively high numbers. Continuous grazing with excessive livestock numbers has had a major impact on the vegetation. The reduction in grass volume also reduces the incidence of wildfires allowing woody seedlings to escape fire and grow large enough to become fire tolerant. Moreover, as overgrazing continues, the more palatable tallgrasses are replaced by less desirable grasses. Basal densities of grass species will decline as does ground litter. Bare ground increases, as does annual production of annual forbs. Soil erosion is not a problem due to the flatness of the landscape. Once the woody invaders to this site such as mesquite, huisache and/or McCartney Rose seedlings appear in small numbers, the window of opportunity to control these plants before they become a serious problem is only very few years. Once the threshold of 15 percent canopy cover is surpassed, control requires a significant amount of resources in time, energy and money to restore the grassland.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for the Deep Sand Site is a Tall/Midgrass Savannah Community (1.1) with a less than 15 percent canopy of primarily live oak trees. Tallgrasses most likely made up over 60 percent of herbaceous production, followed by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. Dominant tallgrasses included big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, and switchgrass. Midgrasses such as little bluestem, Texasgrass, crinkleawn, and Pan American balsamscale made up a significant portion of the herbaceous composition. Perennial forbs such as prairie clover, sensitive briar, and woollywhite are important contributors. Annual forbs occur differing amounts in response to grazing intensity, fire, drought, or excessive precipitation. This savannah site was periodically heavily grazed by bison and both wild and domestic livestock. Continuous heavy grazing came with the advent of barbed wire and windmills in the mid to late 1800's. Overgrazing initially resulted in the reduction and then loss of the tallgrass component, creating loss of total biomass, reduced litter accumulations and reduction of fire frequency and intensity. If overgrazing continues, midgrasses replace tallgrasses, and some shortgrasses and annual forbs begin to dominate the community resulting in the Mid/Shortgrass Savannah Community (1.2).

Trees, consisting of either live oak or post oak, dominate the small mottes found on the site. An occasional American elm or hackberry may be found in the tree mix. Productivity is very high and litter accumulates covering approximately 60 to 75 percent. Crusting does not occur on the soil surface and bare ground is less than 10 percent. Native legumes occur in relatively high numbers. Continuous grazing with excessive livestock numbers has had a major impact on the vegetation. The reduction in grass volume also reduces the incidence of wildfires allowing woody seedlings to escape fire and grow large enough to become fire tolerant. Moreover, as overgrazing continues, the more palatable tallgrasses are replaced by less desirable grasses. Basal densities of grass species will decline as does ground litter. Bare ground increases, as does annual production of annual forbs. Soil erosion is not a problem due to the flatness of the landscape. Once the woody invaders to this site such as mesquite, huisache and/or McCartney Rose seedlings appear in small numbers, the window of opportunity to control these plants before they become a serious problem is only very few years. Once the threshold of 15 percent canopy cover is surpassed, control requires a significant amount of resources in time, energy and money to restore the grassland.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Prairie has very deep sandy soils on uplands. The sands are generally greater than 20 inches deep before reaching a sandy clay loam subsurface horizon.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained, very slowly to moderately rapidly permeable soils. The surface is typically loamy fine sand. Generally, the soils are taxonomically classified as Arenic, but other classifications may be present. The argillic horizon textures range from fine sandy loam to clay loam. Argillic horizons exhibit redoximorphic features and even include plinthite in some pedons. A perched water table on top of the argillic can result following periods of heavy rain events. Soils correlated to this site include: Cheetham, Fordtran, Garcitas, Milby, and Monaville.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a tall/midgrass prairie. It is a fire-maintained, bunchgrass prairie composed of primarily warm-season, tall and midgrasses with a few warm-season perennial forbs and cool-season grasses and forbs. Recurrent fire, primarily during the summers and periodic grazing by bison were natural processes, which maintained this plant community. Under continuous, heavy livestock grazing the taller, more palatable bunchgrasses such as big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, Florida paspalum, and switchgrass decrease and are replaced by mid and shortgrasses. Subsequently, with the resulting reduced fuel loads, fire frequency and intensity decreased. As the process continued, these plants were replaced by even less palatable, less productive midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site is distinguished by its deep productive soils that are richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the region.

Soil Features
These soils are deep, dark colored to olive, slightly acid to calcareous clays. The soils have high shrink-swell properties often forming microdepressions and microknolls. When they are dry and cracked, they take in water rapidly. When they are wet and the cracks have closed, however, the water intake is slow. The soils hold large amounts of water and have high natural fertility. They seal over when cover is inadequate and erosion is then a hazard. The soils are sticky and plastic when wet. When moist, they are crumbly. Good soil structure is generally very evident under grass cover. In this condition, they favor air and water movement and root growth. Soils correlated to this site include: Bleiblerville, Branyon, Denhawken, Dimebox, Elmendorf, Frelsburg, Houston Black, and Luling.

Reference Community
The characteristic plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is a true prairie with few large live oak (Quercus virginiana), elm, and hackberry trees along the draws and in occasional motts. Little bluestem dominates the plant community, making up 40 to 50 percent of the total annual yield. Indiangrass and big bluestem make up another 30 percent. Numerous other grasses occur in the potential plant community but less frequently and in smaller amounts. Texas wintergrass and Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginiana) are perennial cool season plants that occur on the site. A variety of forbs, including Illinois bundleflower, Maximilian sunflower, Engelmann's daisy, and black sampson (Echinacea angustifolia) occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the reference plant community and the prairie landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing, or over-rest and the absence of fire, tend to favor a vegetative shift towards woody species such as mesquite, elm, hackberry, cedar, and locust (Gleditsia triacanthos). Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to a mesquite-shrub dominated community.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, well to moderately well drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative soils series are Atasco, Boy, Buna, Craigen, Dallardsville, Gist, Kountze, Messer, Niwana, Otanya, Segno, Silsbee, Tarkington, and Westcott. The soils range in taxonomic classification, but belong to the soil orders of alfisols and ultisols. The soils are expansive across the region and provide the best medium for growing plants with little to any restrictions.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by longleaf pine. An occasional southern red oak (Quercus falcata) or post oak (Quercus stellata) may be seen, but not enough to be considered co-dominants. The midstory is dependent on time since last fire. Areas with recent burns will have less midstory shrubs present. Indicator shrubs are flameleaf sumac (Rhus copallinum) and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum). Other shrubs present will be American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria). Tall grass species are dominant on the site. Little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) will be the most common, but indicator species are big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum).

Ecological Site Concept
The Poorly Drained Loamy Upland ecological site has very deep, poorly drained soils. The poor drainage pattern causes water to persist for long periods of time after precipitation events. The resulting hydrophytic plant communities are able to withstand the presence of water.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly to very poorly drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative series are Bissonnet, Caddo, Camptown, Evadale, Jasco, Kinder, Olive, Sorter, Tyden, and Waller. Since so many soils belong to this ecological site, their taxonomies vary, but all belong to the orders of alfisols and ultisols. The soils extend throughout the whole region and are widely prolific.

The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine, with longleaf pine as a co-dominant. Other species such as sweetgum (Liquidambar straciflua), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica) may be present, but not in large numbers. The midstory and understory vary significantly, especially with time since last fire. An herbaceous understory will be found directly after a burn and more shrub species will be present as the time since fire lengthens. Common midstory shrubs and trees include wax myrtle (Morella cerifera), dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and redbay (Persea borbonia). Understory species include a variety of sedges (Carex sp.), flatsedges (Cyperus sp.), rushes (Juncus sp.), spikerushes (Eleocharis sp.), and fimbry (Fimbristylis sp.). The presence of spikerushes is oftentimes an indicator of the site. Lizards tail (Saururus cernuus) is the most prolific forb species.

Ecological Site Concept
The Seasonally Wet Loamy Upland ecological site has very deep loamy, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils influenced by seasonal wetness. The sites do not flood or pond, but instead have a fluctuating water table. From winter into late spring, the soils will be saturated to a depth as high as 12 inches below the surface. The deep loamy soils and the seasonally high water table combine to form the plant community.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative soils series are Aldine, Batson, Kirbyville, Plumgrove, Splendora, and Texla. The soils range in taxonomic classification, from Glossudalfs to Paleudalfs to Paleudults, but all are in the same subgroup of Oxyaquic. Oxyaquic refers to soils that are saturated but not reduced, nor having redoximorphic features.

Reference Community
The overstory is dominated by pine species, comprised of longleaf pine and loblolly pine, with little else. Black hickory (Carya tomentosa) and white oak (Quercus alba) may be present, but not in large amounts. Midstory shrub species are sparse, but American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), and wax myrtle (Morella cerifera) may be present. The herbaceous understory is dense and diverse. Little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are dominant, while big bluestem (Andropogon geradii), beaked panicgrass (Panicum anceps), and other panicgrasses (Panicum sp.) are common.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface. Besides the Kirvin series, these soils are correlated: Angie, Arriola, Bayoudan, Bellwood, Bonwier, Bryarly, Bub, Burkeville, Conroe, Cuthbert, Darley, Eastwood, Etoile, Galilee, Gore, Hornbeck, Huntsburg, Lacerda, Maben, Mahan, Meth, Naclina, Nacogdoches, Natchitoches, Newco, Nikful, Oula, Raylake, Redco, Redsprings, Rosenwall, Ruple, Sacul, Sugartown, Tahoula, Trawick, and Woodtell.

Reference Community
Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Ecological Site Concept
The Seasonally Wet Upland site is unique by its upland position on the landscape, while also having a seasonally high water table. Clay soils in the subhorizons cause water to stay in the profile for long periods of time, especially from November to May. Not only does the water table affect the plants, but many of the soils are shallow with their depth to bedrock as low as 16 inches.

Soil Features
The soils consist of shallow to very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils formed from mudstone residuum. The representative soils are: Alusa, Anacoco, Browndell, Colita, Corrigan, Elmina, Felker, Fetzer, Gomery, Kolin, Libuse, Lummus, Metcalf, Tiak, and Wiergate. They are widely varying taxonomically, from alfisols to ultisols to vertisols. Their unifying factor is their upland position with a fluctuating water table. Many of the soils have restrictions to bedrock, classifying them as shallow.

Reference Community
The varying degree of water availability and root restriction cause the understory sites to be highly variable. Common understory species include: longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), sedges (Carex sp.), partridgeberry (Mitchella repens), and Texas ironweed (Vernonia texana). Common shrub species include: American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshallii), and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 30 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, and shrubs make up the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in differing amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, and/or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of reference grasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, application of herbicides, or mowing is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, or Chinese tallow in check.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult.

Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The ecological site is associated with deep, well-drained, moderately rapidly-permeable soils on uplands. Surface soils range from loamy sands, sandy loams, or loams. The clay increase is gradual throughout the soil profile. The profile typically transitions from a sandy/loamy surface to a sandy loam or sandy clay loam subsurface.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface. Besides the Kirvin series, these soils are correlated: Angie, Arriola, Bayoudan, Bellwood, Bonwier, Bryarly, Bub, Burkeville, Conroe, Cuthbert, Darley, Eastwood, Etoile, Galilee, Gore, Hornbeck, Huntsburg, Lacerda, Maben, Mahan, Meth, Naclina, Nacogdoches, Natchitoches, Newco, Nikful, Oula, Raylake, Redco, Redsprings, Rosenwall, Ruple, Sacul, Sugartown, Tahoula, Trawick, and Woodtell.

Reference Community
Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Ecological Site Concept
The Seasonally Wet Upland site is unique by its upland position on the landscape, while also having a seasonally high water table. Clay soils in the subhorizons cause water to stay in the profile for long periods of time, especially from November to May. Not only does the water table affect the plants, but many of the soils are shallow with their depth to bedrock as low as 16 inches.

Soil Features
The soils consist of shallow to very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils formed from mudstone residuum. The representative soils are: Alusa, Anacoco, Browndell, Colita, Corrigan, Elmina, Felker, Fetzer, Gomery, Kolin, Libuse, Lummus, Metcalf, Tiak, and Wiergate. They are widely varying taxonomically, from alfisols to ultisols to vertisols. Their unifying factor is their upland position with a fluctuating water table. Many of the soils have restrictions to bedrock, classifying them as shallow.

Reference Community
The varying degree of water availability and root restriction cause the understory sites to be highly variable. Common understory species include: longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), sedges (Carex sp.), partridgeberry (Mitchella repens), and Texas ironweed (Vernonia texana). Common shrub species include: American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshallii), and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The ecological site is associated with deep, well-drained, moderately rapidly-permeable soils on uplands. Surface soils range from loamy sands, sandy loams, or loams. The clay increase is gradual throughout the soil profile. The profile typically transitions from a sandy/loamy surface to a sandy loam or sandy clay loam subsurface. Soils correlated to this site include: Boykin, Choates, Depcor, Doucette, Hillister, Kurth, Laska, Letney, Lovelady, Malbis, Pinetucky, and Stringtown. 

Reference Community
Longleaf pine trees comprise the majority of the overstory. The occurrence in the overstory on any given site is between 75 to 100 percent. Blackjack and post oaks have established on some sites, each ranging from 0 to 10 percent of the overall canopy structure. Shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) will be found in lesser amounts, usually less than 5 percent. Farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), sassafras (Sassafras albidium), and oak saplings are common in the mid-story layer (4.5 to 13 feet), although overall presence in the system is quite low (0 to 10 percent). Both communities are characterized by a diverse ground layer with minor patches of bare ground and litter (5 to 15 percent and 10 to 30 percent, respectively). Little bluestem and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are the most abundant grasses seen in the two communities. Indicator forbs include, Virginia tephrosia (Tephrosia virginiana), St. Andrew's cross (Hypericum hypericoides), healing croton (Croton argyranthemus), and flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata).

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

The Clayey Bottomland site is very deep with clay surface textures occurring on flood plains. The areas can be flooded and ponded for lengthy durations throughout the year.

Soil Features
The soils are poorly drained to moderately well drained and very deep. Permeability is very slow. The surface texture is typically clay. Soil reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei).

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam site are upland sites with sandy surface soils over loamy subsoils. The surface soils are usually less than 10 inches deep. The site is one of most vegetatively productive uplands sites in the MLRA.

Soil Features
The soils are moderately deep to very deep fine sandy loams and loamy fine sands with a minimum thickness of 10 inches. The sandy surface is underlain by clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam subsoil. Moisture from light showers is readily absorbed by the surface soil, and the subsoil takes in water moderately well. Fertility and water holding capacity are moderate in the surface and high in the subsoil. Air, water, and plant roots move through the soil readily. The soils give up water generously to growing plants. Surface crusts, slower water intake, and increased runoff are characteristics of the soils in a deteriorated condition.

A variety of shrubs, vines, and forbs occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the reference herbaceous plant community and the savannah landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing, over rest, and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species such as eastern persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), and winged elm (Ulmus alata).

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Savannah ecological site is characterized by a fine sandy loam surface soil underlain by a dense clay subsoil. This is also the typifying site to which the MLRA derived it's name. The clay subsoil impacts water movement through the soil, which often perches water.

Soil Features
The soils are shallow to very deep and typically have fine sandy loam surfaces and dense clay subsoil. The fine sandy loam topsoil ranges from 6 to 15 inches deep but averages less than 10 inches. The surface soil takes in water readily but the clay subsoil is very slowly permeable and restricts air movement and root growth. The very slow permeability and shallow topsoil cause the site to be wet in the winter, slow to warm in the spring, and droughty during the growing season. Low to moderate fertility somewhat limits production on this site. Under good management where herbaceous cover and litter are maintained, rills, gullies, pedestals, and soil compaction layers are not present on the site.

Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei).

Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site is distinguished by its deep productive soils that are richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the region.

Soil Features
These soils are deep, dark colored to olive, slightly acid to calcareous clays. The soils have high shrink-swell properties often forming microdepressions and microknolls. When they are dry and cracked, they take in water rapidly. When they are wet and the cracks have closed, however, the water intake is slow. The soils hold large amounts of water and have high natural fertility. They seal over when cover is inadequate and erosion is then a hazard. The soils are sticky and plastic when wet. When moist, they are crumbly. Good soil structure is generally very evident under grass cover. In this condition, they favor air and water movement and root growth. Soils correlated to this site include: Bleiblerville, Branyon, Denhawken, Dimebox, Elmendorf, Frelsburg, Houston Black, and Luling.

Reference Community
The characteristic plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is a true prairie with few large live oak (Quercus virginiana), elm, and hackberry trees along the draws and in occasional motts. Little bluestem dominates the plant community, making up 40 to 50 percent of the total annual yield. Indiangrass and big bluestem make up another 30 percent. Numerous other grasses occur in the potential plant community but less frequently and in smaller amounts. Texas wintergrass and Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginiana) are perennial cool season plants that occur on the site. A variety of forbs, including Illinois bundleflower, Maximilian sunflower, Engelmann's daisy, and black sampson (Echinacea angustifolia) occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the reference plant community and the prairie landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing, or over-rest and the absence of fire, tend to favor a vegetative shift towards woody species such as mesquite, elm, hackberry, cedar, and locust (Gleditsia triacanthos). Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to a mesquite-shrub dominated community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Prairie has very deep sandy soils on uplands. The sands are generally greater than 20 inches deep before reaching a sandy clay loam subsurface horizon.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained, very slowly to moderately rapidly permeable soils. The surface is typically loamy fine sand. Generally, the soils are taxonomically classified as Arenic, but other classifications may be present. The argillic horizon textures range from fine sandy loam to clay loam. Argillic horizons exhibit redoximorphic features and even include plinthite in some pedons. A perched water table on top of the argillic can result following periods of heavy rain events. Soils correlated to this site include: Cheetham, Fordtran, Garcitas, Milby, and Monaville.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a tall/midgrass prairie. It is a fire-maintained, bunchgrass prairie composed of primarily warm-season, tall and midgrasses with a few warm-season perennial forbs and cool-season grasses and forbs. Recurrent fire, primarily during the summers and periodic grazing by bison were natural processes, which maintained this plant community. Under continuous, heavy livestock grazing the taller, more palatable bunchgrasses such as big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, Florida paspalum, and switchgrass decrease and are replaced by mid and shortgrasses. Subsequently, with the resulting reduced fuel loads, fire frequency and intensity decreased. As the process continued, these plants were replaced by even less palatable, less productive midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The sites are characterized by a sandy surface layer that extends 20 to 40 inches to a loamy subsurface layer. The sites are more productive and less droughty than soils with deeper sands, but not as productive as soils with a higher clay content.

Soil Features
The soils are deep to very deep, fine sands and loamy fine sands with a surface 20 to 40 inches thick over loamy subsoils. Water soaks rapidly into the open soils. Even light showers penetrate below the evaporation zone and are more effective on this site than sites with deeper sands. Water retention is relatively low but the soils give up a high percent of their moisture to growing plants. Although air, water, and plant roots move through the soil with ease, frequent rains are needed to produce optimum plant growth. Inherent low fertility causes these soils to produce forage of lower quantity than associated sites with higher clay content. The site is subject to erosion where adequate herbaceous cover is not maintained and on heavy use areas such as roads and livestock trails. Soils correlated to this site include: Demona, Dutek, Newulm, Nimrod, Rehburg, Robco, Silstid, and Styx.

Reference Community
The characteristic plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is an open savannah of post oak and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) trees that shade 20 to 25 percent of the ground. The herbaceous component is mid and tallgrasses and is dominated by little bluestem which usually makes up 50 to 75 percent of the total annual production. Indiangrass, purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus), switchgrass, beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), sand lovegrass (Eragrostis trichodes), brownseed paspalum (Paspalum plicatulum), and thin paspalum (Paspalum setaceum) also occur. Cool season forage plants are scarce on this site. A variety of shrubs, vines, and forbs occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every five to seven years are important in the maintenance of the reference herbaceous plant community and the savannah landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing or over rest and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species. Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to the Shrubland State.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile. Runoff is low and erosion is negligible. Soils correlated to this site include: Addicks, Algoa, Anahuac, Chesterville, Cyfair, Hockley, Katy, Kemah, Labelle, Levac, Meaton, Mocarey, Mockley, Morey, Orcadia, Spindletop, Viterbo, Winnie, Wockley, and Yeaton.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Prairie has very deep sandy soils on uplands. The sands are generally greater than 20 inches deep before reaching a sandy clay loam subsurface horizon.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained, very slowly to moderately rapidly permeable soils. The surface is typically loamy fine sand. Generally, the soils are taxonomically classified as Arenic, but other classifications may be present. The argillic horizon textures range from fine sandy loam to clay loam. Argillic horizons exhibit redoximorphic features and even include plinthite in some pedons. A perched water table on top of the argillic can result following periods of heavy rain events. Soils correlated to this site include: Cheetham, Fordtran, Garcitas, Milby, and Monaville.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a tall/midgrass prairie. It is a fire-maintained, bunchgrass prairie composed of primarily warm-season, tall and midgrasses with a few warm-season perennial forbs and cool-season grasses and forbs. Recurrent fire, primarily during the summers and periodic grazing by bison were natural processes, which maintained this plant community. Under continuous, heavy livestock grazing the taller, more palatable bunchgrasses such as big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, Florida paspalum, and switchgrass decrease and are replaced by mid and shortgrasses. Subsequently, with the resulting reduced fuel loads, fire frequency and intensity decreased. As the process continued, these plants were replaced by even less palatable, less productive midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Bottomlands have soils that are very deep loams and are associated with flooding regimes. The loamy-textured soils allow the water to drain faster than the Clayey Bottomlands, and therefore do not stay inundated as long.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are very deep, somewhat poorly drained, loamy textured, and moderately permeable. They usually receive extra water as overflow from watercourses or as runoff from adjacent higher sites. They are, however, better drained than the Clayey Bottomland sites. The plant-soil-water-air relationship is very favorable for plant growth. These factors, together with the natural fertility of the soil, favor high yields of good quality forage. Nahatche is the representative soil correlated to this ecological site. Nahatche is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, active, nonacid, thermic Aeric Fluvaquents.

The understory may include hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), greenbriar (Smilax spp.), Alabama supplejack (Berchemia scandens), peppervine (Ampelopsis arborea), grape (Vitis spp.), trumpet creeper (Parthenocissus spp.), and honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica). Sedges, Virginia wildrye, switchcane, broadleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium latifolium), and rustyseed paspalum (Paspalum langei) in shaded and wet areas dominate the herbaceous plant community. Various combinations of beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), eastern gamagrass, vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum) may dominate drier, open areas. Continuous yearlong grazing for a succession of years will tend to move the reference herbaceous plant community towards a herbaceous community of common Bermudagrass, dallisgrass, Vasey's grass (Paspalum urvillei), carpetgrass, giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), and annual sumpweed (Iva annua). Prescribed grazing may shift this herbaceous community back towards the reference herbaceous species. Continuous yearlong grazing with no weed or brush management or abandoning the site for several years will tend to move towards a shrub-sapling community. Once woody shrubs and saplings invade the site, brush management in some form must be used to move back toward the Savannah State. Prescribed burning is not a viable management tool on this site due to excess fine fuel moisture.

Ecological Site Concept
The sites are characterized by a sandy surface layer that extends 20 to 40 inches to a loamy subsurface layer. The sites are more productive and less droughty than soils with deeper sands, but not as productive as soils with a higher clay content.

Soil Features
The soils are deep to very deep, fine sands and loamy fine sands with a surface 20 to 40 inches thick over loamy subsoils. Water soaks rapidly into the open soils. Even light showers penetrate below the evaporation zone and are more effective on this site than sites with deeper sands. Water retention is relatively low but the soils give up a high percent of their moisture to growing plants. Although air, water, and plant roots move through the soil with ease, frequent rains are needed to produce optimum plant growth. Inherent low fertility causes these soils to produce forage of lower quantity than associated sites with higher clay content. The site is subject to erosion where adequate herbaceous cover is not maintained and on heavy use areas such as roads and livestock trails. Soils correlated to this site include: Demona, Dutek, Newulm, Nimrod, Rehburg, Robco, Silstid, and Styx.

Reference Community
The characteristic plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is an open savannah of post oak and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) trees that shade 20 to 25 percent of the ground. The herbaceous component is mid and tallgrasses and is dominated by little bluestem which usually makes up 50 to 75 percent of the total annual production.

Cool season forage plants are scarce on this site. A variety of shrubs, vines, and forbs occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every five to seven years are important in the maintenance of the reference herbaceous plant community and the savannah landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing or over rest and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species. Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to the Shrubland State.

The Clayey Bottomland site is very deep with clay surface textures occurring on flood plains. The areas can be flooded and ponded for lengthy durations throughout the year.

Soil Features
The soils are poorly drained to moderately well drained and very deep. Permeability is very slow. The surface texture is typically clay. Soil reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Diagnostic features and horizons include a mollic epipedon, cambic horizon, and vertic features. Soils correlated to this site include: Brazoria, Chicolete, Churnabog, Ganado, Navaca, and Pledger.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

The Clayey Bottomland site is very deep with clay surface textures occurring on flood plains. The areas can be flooded and ponded for lengthy durations throughout the year.

Soil Features
The soils are poorly drained to moderately well drained and very deep. Permeability is very slow. The surface texture is typically clay. Soil reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Diagnostic features and horizons include a mollic epipedon, cambic horizon, and vertic features. Soils correlated to this site include: Brazoria, Chicolete, Churnabog, Ganado, Navaca, and Pledger.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Bottomlands have that soils are very deep loams and are associated with flooding regimes. The loamy-textured soils allow the water to drain faster than the Clayey Bottomlands, and therefore do not stay inundated as long.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep, loamy-textured, and moderately permeable. They usually receive extra water as overflow from watercourses or as runoff from adjacent higher sites. They are, however, better drained than the clayey bottomland sites. The plant-soil-water-air relationship is very favorable for plant growth. These factors, together with the natural fertility of the soil, favor high yields of good quality forage. Soils correlated to this site include: Bosque, Coarsewood, Gowen, Gowker, Hatliff, Highbank, Kanebreak, Nahatche, and Whitesboro.

Reference Community
The reference plant community of this site is a savannah. Oak, elm, hackberry, cottonwood, ash, black willow (Salix nigra), pecan, and other large trees provide about a 40 percent canopy. The overstory canopy is denser immediately adjacent to the watercourse. The understory may include hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), greenbriar (Smilax spp.), Alabama supplejack (Berchemia scandens), peppervine (Ampelopsis arborea), grape (Vitis spp.), trumpet creeper (Parthenocissus spp.) and honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica). Sedges, Virginia wildrye, switchcane, broadleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium latifolium), and rustyseed paspalum (Paspalum langei) in shaded and wet areas dominate the herbaceous plant community. Various combinations of beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), switchgrass, Indiangrass, big (Andropogon gerardii) and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), eastern gamagrass, vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum) may dominate drier, open areas. Continuous yearlong grazing for a succession of years will tend to move the reference herbaceous plant community towards a herbaceous community of common Bermudagrass, dallisgrass, Vasey's grass (Paspalum urvillei), carpetgrass, giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), and annual sumpweed (Iva annua). Prescribed grazing may shift this herbaceous community back towards the reference herbaceous species. Continuous yearlong grazing with no weed or brush management or abandoning the site for several years will tend to move towards a shrub-sapling community. Once woody shrubs and saplings invade the site, brush management in some form must be used to move back toward the savannah state. Prescribed burning is not a viable management tool on this site due to excess fine fuel moisture.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam site are upland sites with sandy surface soils over loamy subsoils. The surface soils are usually less than 10 inches deep. The site is one of most vegetatively productive uplands sites in the MLRA.

Soil Features
The soils are moderately deep to very deep fine sandy loams and loamy fine sands with a minimum thickness of 10 inches. The sandy surface is underlain by clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam subsoil. Moisture from light showers is readily absorbed by the surface soil, and the subsoil takes in water moderately well. Fertility and water holding capacity are moderate in the surface and high in the subsoil. Air, water, and plant roots move through the soil readily. The soils give up water generously to growing plants. Surface crusts, slower water intake, and increased runoff are characteristics of the soils in a deteriorated condition.

Purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus), Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum), switchgrass, tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), and thin paspalum (Paspalum setaceum) also occur. Cool season plants occuring on the site include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia pinnatifida), and sedges (Carex spp.). A variety of shrubs, vines, and forbs occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the reference herbaceous plant community and the savannah landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing, over rest, and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species such as eastern persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), and winged elm (Ulmus alata). Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to the Shrubland State.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Savannah ecological site is characterized by a fine sandy loam surface soil underlain by a dense clay subsoil. This is also the typifying site to which the MLRA derived it's name. The clay subsoil impacts water movement through the soil, which often perches water.

Soil Features
The soils are shallow to very deep and typically have fine sandy loam surfaces and dense clay subsoil. The fine sandy loam topsoil ranges from 6 to 15 inches deep but averages less than 10 inches. The surface soil takes in water readily but the clay subsoil is very slowly permeable and restricts air movement and root growth. The very slow permeability and shallow topsoil cause the site to be wet in the winter, slow to warm in the spring, and droughty during the growing season.

Ecological Site Concept
The sites are characterized by a sandy surface layer that extends 20 to 40 inches to a loamy subsurface layer. The sites are more productive and less droughty than soils with deeper sands, but not as productive as soils with a higher clay content.

Soil Features
The soils are deep to very deep, fine sands and loamy fine sands with a surface 20 to 40 inches thick over loamy subsoils. Water soaks rapidly into the open soils. Even light showers penetrate below the evaporation zone and are more effective on this site than sites with deeper sands. Water retention is relatively low but the soils give up a high percent of their moisture to growing plants. Although air, water, and plant roots move through the soil with ease, frequent rains are needed to produce optimum plant growth. Inherent low fertility causes these soils to produce forage of lower quantity than associated sites with higher clay content. The site is subject to erosion where adequate herbaceous cover is not maintained and on heavy use areas such as roads and livestock trails. Soils correlated to this site include: Demona, Dutek, Newulm, Nimrod, Rehburg, Robco, Silstid, and Styx.

The characteristic plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is an open savannah of post oak and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) trees that shade 20 to 25 percent of the ground. The herbaceous component is mid and tallgrasses and is dominated by little bluestem which usually makes up 50 to 75 percent of the total annual production. Indiangrass, purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus), switchgrass, beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), sand lovegrass (Eragrostis trichodes), brownseed paspalum (Paspalum plicatulum), and thin paspalum (Paspalum setaceum) also occur.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam site are upland sites with sandy surface soils over loamy subsoils. The surface soils are usually less than 10 inches deep. The site is one of most vegetatively productive uplands sites in the MLRA.

Soil Features
The soils are moderately deep to very deep fine sandy loams and loamy fine sands with a minimum thickness of 10 inches. The sandy surface is underlain by clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam subsoil. Moisture from light showers is readily absorbed by the surface soil, and the subsoil takes in water moderately well. Fertility and water holding capacity are moderate in the surface and high in the subsoil. Air, water, and plant roots move through the soil readily. The soils give up water generously to growing plants. Surface crusts, slower water intake, and increased runoff are characteristics of the soils in a deteriorated condition. Soils correlated to this site include: Alum, Bastrop, Chazos, Dubina, Gasil, Gause, Gholson, Hammond, Inez, Marquez, Minerva, Personville, Rosanky, Shiro, Silawa, Spiller, and Travis.

Reference Community
The interpretive plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is a fire-driven savannah of post oak and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) trees that shade 15 to 20 percent of the ground. The herbaceous component of tall and midgrasses and is dominated by little bluestem, Indiangrass, and brownseed paspalum (Paspalum plicatulum), which usually make up 50 to 75 percent of the total annual yield. Purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus), Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum), switchgrass, tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), and thin paspalum (Paspalum setaceum) also occur. Cool season plants occuring on the site include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia pinnatifida), and sedges (Carex spp.). A variety of shrubs, vines, and forbs occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the reference herbaceous plant community and the savannah landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing, over rest, and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species such as eastern persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), and winged elm (Ulmus alata). Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to the Shrubland State.

Ecological Site Concept
The Chalky Ridge sites are characterized by their shallow soils on ridges with high concentrations of chalk, or calcium carbonates.

Soil Features
The soils are dark brown to brownish-gray calcareous clay loams. The surface soil, usually low in organic matter, is underlain by strongly cemented, calcareous sandstone at depths of 11 to 15 inches. The shallow soils severely limit moisture and fertility holding capacity. Roots readily penetrate the parent material, but moisture and minerals are generally not sufficient to support dense stands of high producing grasses. Surface compaction is common. Runoff is high and erosion is a problem when the soil is bare. Renish is the only soil correlated with this site.

Reference Community
The reference plant community of this site is a prairie or very open savannah sparsely covered with single live oak, hackberry, or bumelia trees, or scattered woody mottes that provide 10 percent or less canopy. The scattered trees, tall native grasses, colorful wildflowers, and rolling topography make this an attractive site. The herbaceous plant community is dominated by little bluestem which generally produces 50 to 75 percent of the total annual production. Indiangrass, big bluestem, sideoats grama, and meadow dropseed are important components of the warm season grass population. Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), and Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha) are components of the cool season grass population. Important forbs include gayfeather, Maximillian sunflower (Helianthus maximilliani), Engelmann's daisy, cobea penstemon, black samson, blue sage (Salvia azurea), compass plant (Silphium sp.), bundleflower, and western indigo. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the reference plant community and the prairie landscape structure. Continuous over grazing, or over rest, and the absence of fire tend to favor a transition towards a community dominated by hackberry, prickly pear (Opuntia sp.), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), threeawn (Aristida sp.), Texas wintergrass, and annual broomweed (Amphiachyris amoena). Without corrective grazing management and burning, the transition will continue to a woodland state dominated by cedar, bumelia, elm, and hackberry.

Ecological Site Concept
The Wet Sandy Draw exists on sandy upland depressions and the head of drainageways. The poorly drained sandy soils create a unique and productive plant community.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are very deep, poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in sandy sediments. Because of the seepage from the adjoining slopes, water seeps to the surface for some time following rains. The soil is saturated or nearly saturated most of the year because of the seepage. Cadelake is classified as a sandy, siliceous, thermic Typic Humaquept and is the only soil series mapped for this site.

Reference Community
This reference plant community resembles a wet prairie or wet meadow and is dominated by warm season perennial grasses including maidencane, rice cutgrass, plumegrass, and common rush. Wax myrtle, possumhaw (Ilex decidua), and blackberry (Rubus spp.) are woody shrubs and vines that commonly occur throughout the site. Water oak, willow oak, and black willow provide a 5 to 10 percent canopy and occupy locations influenced by wetness. Water oak occurs on the higher/dryer upslopes while black willow occurs on the lower/wetter position of the site. Willow oak is intermediate between the two. Fire may play a part in the maintenance of the savannah landscape in years of prolonged drought. This site has the potential to produce heavy fine fuel loads but is usually too wet to have fine fuel moisture conditions conducive for burning. Since this site has such favorable moisture regimes, especially during the summer, grazing and browsing by bison, deer, and cattle probably had more influence on the maintenance of the savannah landscape. Due to the wetness of the site, mechanical brush management is rarely a treatment option for this site. The inability to selectively apply broadcast herbicide normally precludes this treatment option, although individual plant treatment with herbicides may be a viable option. Abandonment of the site allows a transitional shift in vegetation towards a shrub-dominated community that, over time, results in a tree/shrub state. The maintenance of the reference plant community seems to require the presence of grazing and browsing animals and periodic fire when conditions permit.

Ecological Site Concept
The Poorly Drained Loamy Upland ecological site has very deep, poorly drained soils. The poor drainage pattern causes water to persist for long periods of time after precipitation events. The resulting hydrophytic plant communities are able to withstand the presence of water.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly to very poorly drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative series are Bissonnet, Caddo, Camptown, Evadale, Jasco, Kinder, Olive, Sorter, Tyden, and Waller. Since so many soils belong to this ecological site, their taxonomies vary, but all belong to the orders of alfisols and ultisols. The soils extend throughout the whole region and are widely prolific.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine, with longleaf pine as a co-dominant. Other species such as sweetgum (Liquidambar straciflua), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica) may be present, but not in large numbers. The midstory and understory vary significantly, especially with time since last fire. An herbaceous understory will be found directly after a burn and more shrub species will be present as the time since fire lengthens. Common midstory shrubs and trees include wax myrtle (Morella cerifera), dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and redbay (Persea borbonia). Understory species include a variety of sedges (Carex sp.), flatsedges (Cyperus sp.), rushes (Juncus sp.), spikerushes (Eleocharis sp.), and fimbry (Fimbristylis sp.). The presence of spikerushes is oftentimes an indicator of the site. Lizards tail (Saururus cernuus) is the most prolific forb species.

The soils range in taxonomic classification, but belong to the soil orders of alfisols and ultisols. The soils are expansive across the region and provide the best medium for growing plants with little to any restrictions.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by longleaf pine. An occasional southern red oak (Quercus falcata) or post oak (Quercus stellata) may be seen, but not enough to be considered co-dominants. The midstory is dependent on time since last fire. Areas with recent burns will have less midstory shrubs present. Indicator shrubs are flameleaf sumac (Rhus copallinum) and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum). Other shrubs present will be American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria). Tall grass species are dominant on the site. Little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) will be the most common, but indicator species are big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). The understory is diverse in forbs as well. Purple coneflower (Echinacea sp.), flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), gayfeathers (Liatris sp.), and Texas ironweed (Veronia texana) are common.

Ecological Site Concept
The sites are characterized by a sandy surface layer that extends 20 to 40 inches to a loamy subsurface layer. The sites are more productive and less droughty than soils with deeper sands, but not as productive as soils with a higher clay content.

Soil Features
The soils are deep to very deep, fine sands and loamy fine sands with a surface 20 to 40 inches thick over loamy subsoils. Water soaks rapidly into the open soils. Even light showers penetrate below the evaporation zone and are more effective on this site than sites with deeper sands. Water retention is relatively low but the soils give up a high percent of their moisture to growing plants. Although air, water, and plant roots move through the soil with ease, frequent rains are needed to produce optimum plant growth. Inherent low fertility causes these soils to produce forage of lower quantity than associated sites with higher clay content. The site is subject to erosion where adequate herbaceous cover is not maintained and on heavy use areas such as roads and livestock trails. Soils correlated to this site include: Demona, Dutek, Newulm, Nimrod, Rehburg, Robco, Silstid, and Styx.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
The sites are characterized by a sandy surface layer that extends 20 to 40 inches to a loamy subsurface layer. The sites are more productive and less droughty than soils with deeper sands, but not as productive as soils with a higher clay content.

Soil Features
The soils are deep to very deep, fine sands and loamy fine sands with a surface 20 to 40 inches thick over loamy subsoils. Water soaks rapidly into the open soils. Even light showers penetrate below the evaporation zone and are more effective on this site than sites with deeper sands. Water retention is relatively low but the soils give up a high percent of their moisture to growing plants. Although air, water, and plant roots move through the soil with ease, frequent rains are needed to produce optimum plant growth. Inherent low fertility causes these soils to produce forage of lower quantity than associated sites with higher clay content. The site is subject to erosion where adequate herbaceous cover is not maintained and on heavy use areas such as roads and livestock trails. Soils correlated to this site include: Demona, Dutek, Newulm, Nimrod, Rehburg, Robco, Silstid, and Styx.

Reference Community
The characteristic plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is an open savannah of post oak and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) trees that shade 20 to 25 percent of the ground. The herbaceous component is mid and tallgrasses and is dominated by little bluestem which usually makes up 50 to 75 percent of the total annual production. Indiangrass, purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus), switchgrass, beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), sand lovegrass (Eragrostis trichodes), brownseed paspalum (Paspalum plicatulum), and thin paspalum (Paspalum setaceum) also occur. Cool season forage plants are scarce on this site. A variety of shrubs, vines, and forbs occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every five to seven years are important in the maintenance of the reference herbaceous plant community and the savannah landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing or over rest and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species. Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to the Shrubland State.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam site are upland sites with sandy surface soils over loamy subsoils. The surface soils are usually less than 10 inches deep. The site is one of most vegetatively productive uplands sites in the MLRA.

Soil Features
The soils are moderately deep to very deep fine sandy loams and loamy fine sands with a minimum thickness of 10 inches. The sandy surface is underlain by clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam subsoil. Moisture from light showers is readily absorbed by the surface soil, and the subsoil takes in water moderately well. Fertility and water holding capacity are moderate in the surface and high in the subsoil. Air, water, and plant roots move through the soil readily. The soils give up water generously to growing plants. Surface crusts, slower water intake, and increased runoff are characteristics of the soils in a deteriorated condition.

Ecological Site Concept
The Deep Sand is characterized by very deep soils with a sand layer that extends at least 40 inches into the subsoil before any noticeable clay accumulations. This causes the site to be droughty.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are very deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable, fine sands. The soils are classified as grossarenic, meaning the sand continues to a depth of 40 inches until a noticeable amount of clay increases in the subsoil. Moisture enters the soil rapidly, and quickly passes through and out of the root zone. Moisture holding capacity and inherent fertility is low. Water erosion is generally not a hazard but the site is susceptible to wind erosion when the soil is exposed. The site is subject to erosion where adequate herbaceous cover is not maintained and on heavy use areas such as roads and livestock trails. Pickton is the representative soil and is fully classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Grossarenic Paleudalf.

Reference Community
The characteristic plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is an open savannah of bluejack oak (Quercus incana), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), and post oak (Quercus stellata) trees that shade up to 25 percent of the ground. The dominant understory shrubs include yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), and American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana). The herbaceous plant community of tall and midgrasses is dominated by little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) which makes up 50 to 65 percent of the total annual production. Sand lovegrass (Eragrostis trichodes), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), and purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus) occur less frequently and in smaller amounts. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every five to seven years are important in the maintenance of the reference plant community and the savannah landscape structure.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Bottomland site is very deep with clay surface textures occurring on flood plains. The areas can be flooded and ponded for lengthy durations throughout the year.

Soil Features
The soils are poorly drained to moderately well drained and very deep. Permeability is very slow. The surface texture is typically clay. Soil reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Diagnostic features and horizons include a mollic epipedon, cambic horizon, and vertic features. Soils correlated to this site include: Brazoria, Chicolete, Churnabog, Ganado, Navaca, and Pledger.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this site is a fire-influenced bottomland savannah. Composition of this community includes a 25 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species are live oak, hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, and black willow. Dominant grasses are Indiangrass, little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species are present in lesser amounts in the more open areas. The major cool-season species present include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, areas of this community were also dominated by giant cane (Arundo donax). Giant cane most likely increased and decreased depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement. The bottomland community is very productive and has a high diversity of grass, forb, and woody species. Removal of fire tends to promote the increase of woody species, while continuous, heavy overgrazing by livestock leads to the reduction of the tall and midgrasses and increases in shorter grasses as well as unpalatable perennial and annual forbs. These changes in the herbaceous portion of the community reduce the potential for fires to be effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase. There is considerable north-south variation in the composition of this community as well as in the associated communities that can occur on this site. For instance, in the reference tree/tallgrass savannah at the southern end of this MLRA favors species such as four flower trichloris and southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei). The more northern communities will contain water oak (Quercus nigra). Mesquite can occur on bottomland sites but is not typically seen throughout the entire region.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Bottomlands have soils that are very deep loams and are associated with flooding regimes. The loamy-textured soils allow the water to drain faster than the Clayey Bottomlands, and therefore do not stay inundated as long.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are very deep, loamy textured, and moderately permeable. They usually receive extra water as overflow from watercourses or as runoff from adjacent higher sites. They are, however, better drained than the Clayey Bottomland sites. The plant-soil- water-air relationship is very favorable for plant growth. These factors, together with the natural fertility of the soil, favor high yields of good quality forage. Soils correlated to the site include: Coarsewood, Degola, Highbank, Navidad, Pursley, Uhland, Warda, Weswood, Whitesboro, and Yahola. 

Reference Community
The reference plant community of this site is a savannah. Oak, elm, hackberry, cottonwood, ash, black willow (Salix nigra), pecan, and other large trees provide about a 20 percent canopy. The overstory canopy is denser immediately adjacent to the watercourse. The understory may include hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), greenbriar (Smilax spp.), Alabama supplejack (Berchemia scandens), peppervine (Ampelopsis arborea), grape (Vitis spp.), trumpet creeper (Parthenocissus spp.), and honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica). Sedges, Virginia wildrye, switchcane, broadleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium latifolium), and rustyseed paspalum (Paspalum langei) in shaded and wet areas dominate the herbaceous plant community. Various combinations of beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), eastern gamagrass, vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum) may dominate drier, open areas. Continuous yearlong grazing for a succession of years will tend to move the reference herbaceous plant community towards a herbaceous community of common Bermudagrass, dallisgrass, Vasey's grass (Paspalum urvillei), carpetgrass, giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), and annual sumpweed (Iva annua). Prescribed grazing may shift this herbaceous community back towards the reference herbaceous species. Continuous yearlong grazing with no weed or brush management or abandoning the site for several years will tend to move towards a shrub-sapling community. Once woody shrubs and saplings invade the site, brush management in some form must be used to move back toward the Savannah State. Prescribed burning is not a viable management tool on this site due to excess fine fuel moisture.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile. Runoff is low and erosion is negligible. Soils correlated to this site include: Addicks, Algoa, Anahuac, Chesterville, Cyfair, Hockley, Katy, Kemah, Labelle, Levac, Meaton, Mocarey, Mockley, Morey, Orcadia, Spindletop, Viterbo, Winnie, Wockley, and Yeaton.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate.

Ecological Site Concept
""The Claypan Prairie is characterized by loamy surface soils underlain by dense, hard clays. This \claypan\"""" restricts air and water movements, as well as root penetration.""""""

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep, noncalcareous sandy loams and clay loams. The topsoil is underlain at rather shallow depths by dense, hard, clayey material which restricts air, water movement, and root growth. The soils take in water slowly, but can hold large amounts of water and plant nutrients. The soils of this site give up water grudgingly to growing plants. Plants may wilt even though the soil has a comparatively high moisture content. Heavy surface crusts develop in the absence of good vegetative cover. Soils correlated to the site include: Axtell, Bremond, Crockett, Hallettsville, Mabank, Normangee, and Wilson.

Reference Community
The reference plant community of this site is a prairie or very open savannah. Live oak (Quercus virginiana), winged elm, or hackberry may occur along water courses or in scattered mottes and provide 5 to 10 percent canopy cover. Large, old post oak trees may be widely scattered over this site. The herbaceous plant community is dominated by little bluestem and Indiangrass which usually constitutes 50 to 65 percent of the total annual yield. Switchgrass, big bluestem, Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), silver bluestem, and tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus) are important components of the warm season grass population. Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), and Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha) are components of the cool season grass population. Important forbs include Engelmann's daisy, gayfeather (Liatris spp.), bundleflower, prairie petunia (Ruellia humilis), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every three to five years are important in the maintenance of the reference plant community and the prairie landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing, or over-rest, and the absence of fire tend to favor a vegetative shift towards woody species such as mesquite, elm, hackberry, post oak, persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), and honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos). Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to the Oak/Mesquite/Midgrass Savannah Community.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Prairie has very deep sandy soils on uplands. The sands are generally greater than 20 inches deep before reaching a sandy clay loam subsurface horizon.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained, very slowly to moderately rapidly permeable soils. The surface is typically loamy fine sand. Generally, the soils are taxonomically classified as Arenic, but other classifications may be present. The argillic horizon textures range from fine sandy loam to clay loam. Argillic horizons exhibit redoximorphic features and even include plinthite in some pedons. A perched water table on top of the argillic can result following periods of heavy rain events. Soils correlated to this site include: Cheetham, Fordtran, Garcitas, Milby, and Monaville.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a tall/midgrass prairie. It is a fire-maintained, bunchgrass prairie composed of primarily warm-season, tall and midgrasses with a few warm-season perennial forbs and cool-season grasses and forbs. Recurrent fire, primarily during the summers and periodic grazing by bison were natural processes, which maintained this plant community. Under continuous, heavy livestock grazing the taller, more palatable bunchgrasses such as big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, Florida paspalum, and switchgrass decrease and are replaced by mid and shortgrasses. Subsequently, with the resulting reduced fuel loads, fire frequency and intensity decreased. As the process continued, these plants were replaced by even less palatable, less productive midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam. The diagnostic horizons for the representative series include a mollic or ochric epipedon followed by a cambic epipedon. Soils correlated to this site include: Asa, Clemville, Mohat, Navidad, Neches, Norwood, Odem, Riolomas, Rydolph, Sinton, and Snakecreek. The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Ecological Site Concept
The Well Drained Bottomland ecological site has well drained soils in bottomlands found adjacent to waterways. The sandy and loamy soils drain water quickly from the site, but their proximity to flood-prone waterways creates a unique mixture of plant species. The plants are adapted to withstand flooding and dryness because of the rapid permeability.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, moderately well drained and well drained soils formed from sandy sediments and loamy alluvium. Hatliff and Voss are the representative series and are classified as a coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Fluventic Dystrudept and a mixed, thermic, Oxyaquic Udipsamment, respectively. As with soils that are entisols and inceptisols, extensive horizon development has not occurred. The horizons are generally separated by a change in color as their textures are similar throughout the entire profile. The subsurface is saturated for at least 20 consecutive days, or 30 cumulative days throughout the year.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine and American beech. Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and water oak (Quercus nigra) are common and an occasional swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii) will be mixed in. Shrub species can vary, but American hornbeam is prolific, with eastern baccharis (Baccharis halimifolia) and witchhazel (Hamamelis virginiana) mixed in. Since the overstory canopy is somewhat closed, grass and forb species can be sparse. Thick stands of switchcane and broadleaf uniola will be present nearest the waterway where more sunlight exists. These species also stabilize the soil with their roots.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy ecological site is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, very dark gray to very dark grayish brown, very strongly acid to neutral loamy uplands. They have a thick loamy noneffervescent surface from 18 to 30 inches thick over slowly permeable clayey subsoils. The soils hold moderate amounts of water and are moderately fertile. Runoff is low and erosion is negligible.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
Loamy Bottomlands occupy the lowest setting on the landscape. They are comprised of flood plains formed from loamy alluvium. Flooding can occur on these sites.

Soil Features
The Loamy Bottomlands consist of very deep, well drained, slow to moderately permeable, neutral to moderately alkaline soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. Surface textures are mainly silty clay loam, silt loam, and loam but can include clay loam and sandy clay loam.

The Neches series is a man-made bottomland from spoil, but is included with this description until further concept development.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire climax tallgrass savannah. Composition of this community includes a 20 to 40 percent canopy of individual trees or clumps of trees. The major tree species include hackberry, pecan, cedar elm, green ash, bald cypress, and black willow (Salix nigra). Dominant grasses are yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum). Cool-season species present in small amounts include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), Texas wintergrass, and sedges. Historically, large areas of giant cane appeared on this site. The giant cane would be the dominant grass species in the plant community. This type of community most likely waxed and waned depending upon grazing and fire events and eventually disappeared under the influence of European settlement, land clearing, and grazing. This bottomland community is very productive and has a reasonable diversity of grasses, forbs, and woody plants. Removal of fire from this ecosystem tends to increase woody plants. Continuous heavy grazing by livestock leads to a reduction of tallgrasses and an increase in midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs. These changes in the herbaceous community reduce fire intensity and possibly frequency, making fire less effective in woody plant control and woody species tend to increase.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Soil correlated to this site include: Aris, Cieno, Clodine, Edgerly, Gessner, Leton, Prairieland, Rexville, and Tomball.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Well Drained Bottomland ecological site has well drained soils in bottomlands found adjacent to waterways. The sandy and loamy soils drain water quickly from the site, but their proximity to flood-prone waterways creates a unique mixture of plant species. The plants are adapted to withstand flooding and dryness because of the rapid permeability.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, moderately well drained and well drained soils formed from sandy sediments and loamy alluvium. Hatliff and Voss are the representative series and are classified as a coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Fluventic Dystrudept and a mixed, thermic, Oxyaquic Udipsamment, respectively. As with soils that are entisols and inceptisols, extensive horizon development has not occurred. The horizons are generally separated by a change in color as their textures are similar throughout the entire profile. The subsurface is saturated for at least 20 consecutive days, or 30 cumulative days throughout the year.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by loblolly pine and American beech. Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and water oak (Quercus nigra) are common and an occasional swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii) will be mixed in. Shrub species can vary, but American hornbeam is prolific, with eastern baccharis (Baccharis halimifolia) and witchhazel (Hamamelis virginiana) mixed in. Since the overstory canopy is somewhat closed, grass and forb species can be sparse. Thick stands of switchcane and broadleaf uniola will be present nearest the waterway where more sunlight exists. These species also stabilize the soil with their roots.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

All three have slightly different taxonomic classifications, but all are within the endoaquept great group. The soils belong to the inceptisol soil order, meaning they have weak horizon development and are generally separated by changes in color. This is due to the addition and removal of soil as the site floods. Also due to flooding, prolonged intervals without access to air cause the soil to have a gleyed, or grey, color. The gleyed horizon can be found within 6 to 27 inches.

Ecological Site Concept
The Poorly Drained Loamy Bottomland ecological site has very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are frequently flooded. The site is typically flooded for brief to long periods during normal rainfall years. They will stay flooded starting in November and ending in May. The loamy-textured soils combined with the flooding frequency form the plant community.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvial deposits of the Holocene age. Kian, Pluck, and Sourlake are the representative soil series. All three have slightly different taxonomic classifications, but all are within the endoaquept great group. The soils belong to the inceptisol soil order, meaning they have weak horizon development and are generally separated by changes in color. This is due to the addition and removal of soil as the site floods. Also due to flooding, prolonged intervals without access to air cause the soil to have a gleyed, or grey, color. The gleyed horizon can be found within 6 to 27 inches.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is co-dominated by willow oak (Quercus phellos) and water oak (Quercus nigra). Other species commonly found mixed in are sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and bald cypress (Taxodium distichum). Buttressed trunk bases are found on most of the overstory trees. Possumhaw (Ilex decidua) is the most common shrub found, while red maple (Acer rubrum) and hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana) are shrub-like trees found onsite. The herbaceous understory can be lush or nearly vacant depending on flood length and canopy cover. Sedges (Carex sp.), flatsedges (Cyperus sp.), and rushes (Juncus sp.) dominate the understory.

Ecological Site Concept
The Swamp ecological site has very deep, very poorly drained soils greater than 80 inches (203 centimeters) that are ponded throughout a portion of the year. A wetland plant community exists because it is the lowest position on the landscape, along with the flooding and ponding regimes.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by gleyed horizons throughout the entire soil profile, measured to 80 inches (203 centimeters). The gleying, or grey soil color, is a result of anaerobic conditions from the soils being saturated for long periods. The soils show little soil development indicative of the entisols soil order. The surface layer is darkest and the underlying subsoil layers are mostly distinguished by color and exhibit more hydric soil features besides gleying. Iron-manganese masses, oxidized root channels, and other indicators of anoxic conditions are evident. The Cowmarsh series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvial deposits of the Holocene age. The series is classified as a fine, smectitic, acid, thermic Typic Fluvaqeunt.

Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam ecological site typically has a fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam surface. Sandy clay loam subsoil horizons are generally present 15 to 18 inches below the surface.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, moderately well or well drained, with very slow or slow permeability. Other features consist of moderately acid to neutral soil reaction. The dominant surface texture is fine sandy loam with some inclusions of loamy fine sand. Diagnostic features and horizons include an ochric epipedon and argillic horizon. A representative ochric epipedon ranges from 5 to 10 inches thick. Some pedons exhibit vertic properties in the argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Blanconia, Copano, Fulshear, Inez, and Morales.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent grassland composed primarily of tallgrasses and midgrasses that make up to 70 percent of the composition. Forbs make up 5 percent of the composition and woody shrubs, mainly yaupon, American beautyberry, and dewberry (Rubus spp.), comprise 5 percent of the composition. Trees, consisting of either live oak or post oak, dominate the small mottes found on the site. An occasional American elm or hackberry may be found in the tree mix. Productivity is very high and litter accumulates covering approximately 60 to 75 percent. Crusting does not occur on the soil surface and bare ground is less than 10 percent. Native legumes occur in relatively high numbers. Continuous grazing with excessive livestock numbers has had a major impact on the vegetation. The reduction in grass volume also reduces the incidence of wildfires allowing woody seedlings to escape fire and grow large enough to become fire tolerant. Moreover, as overgrazing continues, the more palatable tallgrasses are replaced by less desirable grasses. Basal densities of grass species will decline as does ground litter. Bare ground increases, as does annual production of annual forbs. Soil erosion is not a problem due to the flatness of the landscape. Once the woody invaders to this site such as mesquite, huisache and/or McCartney Rose seedlings appear in small numbers, the window of opportunity to control these plants before they become a serious problem is only very few years. Once the threshold of 15 percent canopy cover is surpassed, control requires a significant amount of resources in time, energy and money to restore the grassland.

Ecological Site Concept
As named, the Lowland ecological site occurs on the lowest part of the landscape. It receives excess water from surround landforms and may stay wet for extended periods throughout the year.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. The soil profile characteristically consists of an ochric horizon and then an argillic horizon. The ochric can measure 3 to 20 inches thick with an average of 10 inches. Crayfish krotovinas are found within the upper 60 inches. Surface horizon reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Reference Community
This site is interspersed within the upland prairie sites on the Coastal Prairie. It is part of the tall/midgrass prairie complex that developed under intermittent grazing by bison and frequent winter and summer fires. The potential plant community on the site is a wet prairie dominated by tall and midgrasses. However, it varies between wet and dry cycles. During dry periods, tallgrasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, maidencane, and Florida paspalum can make up as much as 50 percent of the total herbaceous vegetation with the remainder composed of various mid and shortgrass species. During wet cycles, the tallgrasses decrease except around the edges of the site, while longtom paspalum, sedges, and knotroot bristlegrass dominate. Maidencane and giant cutgrass can be common, depending on the depth of the depression. Forbs are a small component, but annual forbs may be seasonally abundant in response to drought sequences. Abusive grazing by domestic livestock removes the tallgrass components, reduces fire and allows species such as longtom paspalum to increase. Woody plants are absent in the reference community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The representative soil features are very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained with very slow permeability. Soils are nonsaline to very slight and sodicity is none to slight within the top 20 inches of the surface. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Diagnostic horizons and features include an ochric epipedon typically 6 inches thick over an argillic horizon. Soils correlated to this site include: Edco, Edna, Nada, Telf, Vidauri, and Wyick.

Reference Community
The reference community is a grassland of mid and tallgrasses. Midgrasses make up over 50 percent of the composition, whereas tallgrasses contribute to 30 percent, and other grasses and forbs make up the remainder. Historically coupled with bison grazing, winter and summer fires occurred every 2 to 3 years. Annual forbs occur, but mainly in response to drought, fire, and high precipitation sequences. The introduction of large numbers of cattle, combined with the concentration of herds through fencing and water locations, reduced grass fuel loads thus reducing the occurrence of fire. Heavy grazing reduced the tallgrasses in the plant composition to be replaced by midgrasses, shortgrasses, and eventually annual forbs and grasses. The Mid/Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) can be maintained with proper stocking rates, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Prairie has very deep sandy soils on uplands. The sands are generally greater than 20 inches deep before reaching a sandy clay loam subsurface horizon.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained, very slowly to moderately rapidly permeable soils. The surface is typically loamy fine sand. Generally, the soils are taxonomically classified as Arenic, but other classifications may be present. The argillic horizon textures range from fine sandy loam to clay loam. Argillic horizons exhibit redoximorphic features and even include plinthite in some pedons. A perched water table on top of the argillic can result following periods of heavy rain events. Soils correlated to this site include: Cheetham, Fordtran, Garcitas, Milby, and Monaville.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a tall/midgrass prairie. It is a fire-maintained, bunchgrass prairie composed of primarily warm-season, tall and midgrasses with a few warm-season perennial forbs and cool-season grasses and forbs. Recurrent fire, primarily during the summers and periodic grazing by bison were natural processes, which maintained this plant community. Under continuous, heavy livestock grazing the taller, more palatable bunchgrasses such as big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, Florida paspalum, and switchgrass decrease and are replaced by mid and shortgrasses. Subsequently, with the resulting reduced fuel loads, fire frequency and intensity decreased. As the process continued, these plants were replaced by even less palatable, less productive midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire maintained, open grassland with gulf cordgrass and little bluestem accompanied by lesser amounts of switchgrass, Hartweg's paspalum, seashore saltgrass, marshhay cordgrass and traces of bushy sea oxeye. Warm-season grasses are prolific throughout. Forbs and woody species make up a minor component of this community. Variations in salinity and soil moisture cause local variations in the plant community. In low-lying, highly saline areas, gulf cordgrass may occur in pure stands. Areas with less salinity in the soil will have higher plant diversity. Cordgrasses reproduce vegetatively by rhizomes and are resilient to disturbance. However, once gulf cordgrass is eliminated, it is hard to reestablish. Reseeding is not an option for this site because most of the native species found on this site produce sterile seeds. To reestablish these species transplanting is possible for reestablishment. Heavy grazing pressure will quickly suppress little bluestem leading to a dominance of Gulf cordgrass. Gulf cordgrass becomes highly palatable to livestock when burned; however, it is unpalatable when not burned frequently. Not only does fire help to control woody plant species within this plant community, but it also helps to maintain a significant component of little bluestem when properly grazed.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a grassland composed of tall and midgrasses. Tallgrasses make up over 60 percent, midgrasses approximately 35 percent, and other associated grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees make the remainder of the plant community. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to disturbance from grazing, fire, or drought. Chronic overgrazing results in a reduction of biomass, reduced litter accumulation, loss of tallgrasses and some midgrasses, and less ability to use fire effectively for management. Some mid and shortgrasses increase because of this overgrazing. Prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, and/or the application of herbicides is necessary to keep invading woody species such as huisache, Macartney rose, yaupon, wax myrtle, and/or Chinese tallow from invading.

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a tall/midgrass prairie. It is a fire-maintained, bunchgrass prairie composed of primarily warm-season, tall and midgrasses with a few warm-season perennial forbs and cool-season grasses and forbs. Recurrent fire, primarily during the summers and periodic grazing by bison were natural processes, which maintained this plant community. Under continuous, heavy livestock grazing the taller, more palatable bunchgrasses such as big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, Florida paspalum, and switchgrass decrease and are replaced by mid and shortgrasses. Subsequently, with the resulting reduced fuel loads, fire frequency and intensity decreased. As the process continued, these plants were replaced by even less palatable, less productive midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs.

Ecological Site Concept
The Southern Loamy Prairie is characterized by very deep loamy soils occurring on uplands. They are vegetatively productive and provide good grazing for livestock.

Soil Features
Sites consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The typical surface texture is fine sandy loam but can include very fine sandy loam. The average thickness of the surface horizon is 15 inches but can range from 8 to 20 inches over a fine argillic horizon. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral with none to very slight salinity. Soils correlated to this site include: Faddin, Garwood, Inari, Mentz, Midfield, Orelia, Telferner, Texana, and Tidehaven.

Reference Community
This reference plant community is a fire-dependent prairie composed primarily of tall and midgrasses that make up 65 percent of the composition. Midgrasses make up about 30 percent and forbs make up 5 percent of the composition. Historically, grazing by bison was intermittent and fires, both summer and winter, likely occurred on a 4 to 5-year basis. Annual forbs occur in cycles based primarily on when rainfall occurs or a combination of rainfall and drought. As the bison were replaced by cattle, grazing became much more constant and concentrated. This heavy grazing reduced the grass fuel load and reduced the occurrence of wildfires. As continuous heavy grazing continued, midgrasses, shortgrasses, and annual forbs replaced the more palatable tallgrasses. Seedlings of mesquite and huisache can slowly become established on the site with the reduction of tallgrass competition and the loss of fire. As the mesquite and/or huisache seedlings become established, there is about a 10-year window when management can be applied to the area to restore the tall and midgrasses. This involves the use of grazing management with frequent deferment from all livestock grazing. Prescribed burning is imperative, and chemical brush and weed control may be necessary. Even if there are no livestock, prescribed burning, with chemical brush and weed control may still be needed.

Ecological Site Concept
The sites are characterized by a sandy surface layer that extends 20 to 40 inches to a loamy subsurface layer. The sites are more productive and less droughty than soils with deeper sands, but not as productive as soils with a higher clay content.

Soil Features
The soils are deep to very deep, fine sands and loamy fine sands with a surface 20 to 40 inches thick over loamy subsoils. Water soaks rapidly into the open soils. Even light showers penetrate below the evaporation zone and are more effective on this site than sites with deeper sands. Water retention is relatively low but the soils give up a high percent of their moisture to growing plants. Although air, water, and plant roots move through the soil with ease, frequent rains are needed to produce optimum plant growth. Inherent low fertility causes these soils to produce forage of lower quantity than associated sites with higher clay content. The site is subject to erosion where adequate herbaceous cover is not maintained and on heavy use areas such as roads and livestock trails. Soils correlated to this site include: Demona, Dutek, Newulm, Nimrod, Rehburg, Robco, Silstid, and Styx.

Reference Community
The characteristic plant community of this site is the reference plant community. This site is an open savannah of post oak and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) trees that shade 20 to 25 percent of the ground. The herbaceous component is mid and tallgrasses and is dominated by little bluestem which usually makes up 50 to 75 percent of the total annual production. Indiangrass, purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus), switchgrass, beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), sand lovegrass (Eragrostis trichodes), brownseed paspalum (Paspalum plicatulum), and thin paspalum (Paspalum setaceum) also occur. Cool season forage plants are scarce on this site. A variety of shrubs, vines, and forbs occur in this community. Grazing prescriptions that permit acceptable grazing periods and allow adequate rest periods along with prescribed fire every five to seven years are important in the maintenance of the reference herbaceous plant community and the savannah landscape structure. Continuous overgrazing or over rest and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species. Without corrective measures, this shift will continue to the Shrubland State.

The Seasonally Wet Loamy Upland ecological site has very deep loamy, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils influenced by seasonal wetness. The sites do not flood or pond, but instead have a fluctuating water table. From winter into late spring, the soils will be saturated to a depth as high as 12 inches below the surface. The deep loamy soils and the seasonally high water table combine to form the plant community.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative soils series are Aldine, Batson, Kirbyville, Plumgrove, Splendora, and Texla. The soils range in taxonomic classification, from Glossudalfs to Paleudalfs to Paleudults, but all are in the same subgroup of Oxyaquic. Oxyaquic refers to soils that are saturated but not reduced, nor having redoximorphic features.

Reference Community
The overstory is dominated by pine species, comprised of longleaf pine and loblolly pine, with little else. Black hickory (Carya tomentosa) and white oak (Quercus alba) may be present, but not in large amounts. Midstory shrub species are sparse, but American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), and wax myrtle (Morella cerifera) may be present. The herbaceous understory is dense and diverse. Little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are dominant, while big bluestem (Andropogon geradii), beaked panicgrass (Panicum anceps), and other panicgrasses (Panicum sp.) are common.

Ecological Site Concept
The Well Drained Loamy Upland ecological site has very deep loamy, well to moderately well drained soils. These sites have the highest potential for producing biomass across the area. They support high quality stands of timber and dense stands of herbaceous vegetation.

Soil Features
The soils consist of very deep, well to moderately well drained soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits. The representative soils series are Atasco, Boy, Buna, Craigen, Dallardsville, Gist, Kountze, Messer, Niwana, Otanya, Segno, Silsbee, Tarkington, and Westcott. The soils range in taxonomic classification, but belong to the soil orders of alfisols and ultisols. The soils are expansive across the region and provide the best medium for growing plants with little to any restrictions.

Reference Community
The overstory canopy is dominated by longleaf pine. An occasional southern red oak (Quercus falcata) or post oak (Quercus stellata) may be seen, but not enough to be considered co-dominants. The midstory is dependent on time since last fire. Areas with recent burns will have less midstory shrubs present. Indicator shrubs are flameleaf sumac (Rhus copallinum) and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum). Other shrubs present will be American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria). Tall grass species are dominant on the site. Little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) will be the most common, but indicator species are big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). The understory is diverse in forbs as well. Purple coneflower (Echinacea sp.), flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), gayfeathers (Liatris sp.), and Texas ironweed (Veronia texana) are common.

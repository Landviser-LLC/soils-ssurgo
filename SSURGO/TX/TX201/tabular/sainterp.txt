"TX201"|"AWM - Manure and Food Processing Waste"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Manure and Food Processing Waste"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Manure and Food Processing Waste"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Manure is the excrement of livestock and poultry.  The consistency of manure is labile.  It changes in storage or treatment, and it depends upon the bedding used and upon whether the manure is diluted or allowed to dry.  Food processing wastes consist of damaged fruit and vegetables and the peelings, stems, leaves, pits, and soil particles removed in food preparation.  Most wastes produced in the processing of milk, cheese, and meat are liquids.  Paunch manure is an exception.

Manure and food processing wastes have variable nitrogen content.  The material is solid, slurry, or liquid.  A high nitrogen content limits the application rate.  Toxic or otherwise dangerous wastes, such as those mixed with the lye used in food processing, are outside the meaning of manure and food processing wastes as used in this interpretation.

Scope: National

The soil rating guide is based on utilizing the nutrients in the wastes for crop production and is not directed toward reclaiming or restoring critical areas or making the most efficient use of moisture.  Applications of liquid wastes can be made by tank wagon or conventional irrigation methods that are modified as necessary to function properly.  Applications of solid and slurry wastes can be made at the surface or subsurface.

This interpretive rule uses the criteria published in the AGRICULTURAL WASTE MANAGEMENT FIELD HANDBOOK (Part 651), Engineering Division, Natural Resources Conservation Service, USDA.

Soil properties and qualities considered are those that affect soil absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, the susceptibility to wind or water erosion, and the rate and method of the application of wastes.  Soil properties that affect absorption are permeability, the depth to a seasonal high water table, sodium adsorption ratio, the depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and the available water capacity.  Soil reaction, sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density are soil properties that affect plant growth and microbial activity.  The wind erodibility group, erosion factor, slopes, and susceptibility to flooding are used to measure the potential for wind and water erosion. Stones and the depth to a seasonal high water table can interfere with the application of wastes.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to the treatment of wastes.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Low adsorption: Soils with low CEC to clay ratio have limited potential for sequestering heavy metals and other potential pollutants found in agricultural waste and sustaining vigorous plant growth.

"TX201"|"ENG - Septic Tank Absorption Fields"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Septic Tank Absorption Fields"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Septic Tank Absorption Fields"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.  

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Septic tank absorption fields are subsurface systems of tile or perforated pipe that distribute effluent from a septic tank into the natural soil.  The centerline depth of the tile is assumed to be 24 inches or deeper.  Only the soil between depths of 24 and 60 inches is considered in making the ratings.  Soil properties and site features considered are those that affect the absorption of the effluent, those that affect the construction and maintenance of the system, and those that may affect public health.

Scope: National

Farm and ranch homesteads, outbuildings, and recreational facilities require a means to safely dispose of effluent.  Septic Tank Absorption Field interpretations are a tool for guiding the user in site selection for safe disposal of household effluent.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage to the soil surface, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or flood water.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Soil properties and qualities that affect the absorption of the effluent are permeability, depth to a seasonal high water table, depth to bedrock, depth to a cemented pan, and susceptibility to flooding.  Stones and boulders and a shallow depth to bedrock, ice, or a cemented pan interfere with installation.  Subsidence interferes with installation and maintenance.  Excessive slope may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the effluent in down-slope areas.  In addition, soil erosion is a hazard where absorption fields are installed in steep soils.
 
Some soils are underlain by loose sand and gravel or fractured bedrock at a depth less than 4 feet below the distribution lines.  In these soils, the absorption field may not adequately filter the effluent, particularly when the system is new; consequently, ground water supplies may be contaminated.
 
Percolation tests are used by some regulatory agencies to evaluate the suitability of a soil for septic tank absorption fields.  These tests should be performed during the season when the water table is highest and the soil is at minimum absorptive capacity.

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Land Application of Municipal Sewage Sludge"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Land Application of Municipal Sewage Sludge"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Municipal sewage sludge is the residual product of the treatment of municipal sewage.  The solid component is composed mainly of cell mass, primarily bacteria cells which have developed during secondary treatment and which have incorporated soluble organic into their own bodies.  Sludge also contains small amounts of sand, silt, and other solid debris.

The water content of sludge ranges from about 98 percent to about 40 percent or less.  The sludge is called liquid if it is more than about 90 percent water, slurry if it is about 90 to 50 percent water, and solid if it is less than about 50 percent water.  Depending on the water content, the sludge can be moved by pump, conveyor, or auger.

Municipal sewage sludges have a variable nitrogen content.  Some sludge contains constituents that are toxic to plant growth or hazardous to the food chain (such as heavy metals or exotic organic compounds) and should be chemically analyzed prior to use.

Scope: National

The soil-rating guide is based on utilizing the nutrients in the waste for crop production and is not directed toward reclaiming or restoring critical areas or making the most efficient use of moisture.  Applications of slurry sludge can be by tank wagon or by irrigation equipment that is modified as necessary to function properly.  Applications of solid and slurry sludges can be made at the surface or subsurface.

The soil properties and qualities considered in the ratings are those that affect soil absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, the susceptibility to wind or water erosion, and the rate and method of application.  Soil properties and qualities that affect absorption are permeability, the depth to a seasonal high water table, soil reaction, sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density.  They also affect plant growth and microbial activity.  Slope and the susceptibility to flooding are used to measure the potential for water erosion.  Stones and the depth to a seasonal high water table can interfere with the application of wastes.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to the treatment of wastes.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

In this process, the wastewater is applied in a level basin and percolates through the soil.  The treated water eventually reaches the ground water.  Application rates range from 4 to 120 inches per week.

The wastewater considered generally is from municipal wastewater treatment plants.  The nitrogen content generally is low.  Normally, the heavy metal content is low; however, chemical analysis should be made prior to use.  Because the thickness of soil material needed for proper renovation of the wastewater is more than 72 inches, geologic and hydrologic investigations during the planning stages.  This information is needed to ensure proper design and to determine reliability of performance as well as the potential for pollution of the ground water.

Scope: National

The soil-rating guide is based on the treatment of the wastewater and not utilizing wastewater for irrigating of crops.  Vegetation is not a necessary part of the treatment design or process but the basin may be vegetated.

The soil properties and qualities that influence risk of pollution, design and construction, and performance are major considerations.  Depth to a seasonal high water table, flooding, and depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan present potential hazards and influence design and construction.  Slope and stones are also important considerations in design and construction.  The properties and qualities that influence performance are permeability and soil reaction.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to treating wastewater.

	13.  Subsidence due to gypsum:  Addition of water in excess of evapotranspiration may cause dissolution and removal of soluble soil material.  Eventually, voids will form in the soil which will manifested at the surface as depressions.  These will collect water which will cause uneven distribution of irrigation water and exacerbate the dissolution problem.  Subsidence is estimated from the gypsum content of the soil.  Other soluble salts may also contribute to the loss of volume of the soil.  

Assumptions:

		* Differential subsidence is assumed to always occur, rather than an equidimensional settling.

"TX201"|"AWM - Slow Rate Process Treatment of Wastewater"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Slow Rate Process Treatment of Wastewater"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Slow Rate Process Treatment of Wastewater"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

In this process wastewater is applied to the land at a rate normally between 0.5 and 4.0 inches per week.  The primary purpose is wastewater treatment rather than irrigation of crops.  Application rates commonly exceed those needed for supplemental irrigation for crop production.  The applied wastewater is treated as it moves through the soil.  Much of the treated water percolates to the ground water and some enter the atmosphere by evapotranspiration.  Surface runoff of the applied water generally is not allowed.  Water-logging is avoided either through control of the application rate or the use of tile drains, or both.

The wastewater considered includes municipal wastewater and effluent from food-processing plants, lagoons, and storage ponds.  Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality.  It contains domestic waste and possibly industrial waste.  It may be, although rarely is, untreated sewage or may be wastewater that has received primary or secondary treatment.  Food-processing wastewater is the wastewater resulting from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption.  In some places, it is high in sodium and chloride.  Lagoon and storage pond effluents, as discussed here, refer to the effluents from a facility used to treat or store food-processing wastewater, domestic wastes, or animal wastes.  Domestic and food-processing wastewater is very dilute, and the effluent from facilities that treat or store it commonly is very low in carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter.  The nitrogen content ranges from 10 to 30 mg/l.  Lagoons or storage ponds for animal wastes have an effluent that has a much higher concentration of these materials mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as domestic wastes.  The nitrogen content varies considerably but generally is 50 to 2,000 mg/l.  The heavy metal content generally is low; however, chemical analyses should be made prior to use.

Scope: National

The soil-rating guide is based on the treatment of the wastewater and not utilizing wastewater for irrigating of crops.  Vegetation is not a necessary part of the treatment design or process but the basin may be vegetated.  However, it is assumed that crops are grown or may be grown as a part of the soil-plant treatment process.  Checks should be made to ensure that heavy metals and nitrogen are not added in excessive amounts.

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that affect soil absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, the susceptibility to wind or water erosion, and the application of wastes.  Properties and qualities that affect absorption are the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to a seasonal high water table, the available water capacity, permeability, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, soil reaction, cation exchange capacity, and slope.  Soil reaction, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density are soil properties that affect plant growth and microbial activity.  Wind erodibility group, erosion factor, slope, and susceptibility to flooding are used to measure the potential for wind erosion and water erosion.  Stones can interfere with the application of wastes.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to treating wastewater.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Low adsorption: Soils with low CEC to clay ratio have limited potential for sequestering heavy metals and other potential pollutants found in agricultural waste and sustaining vigorous plant growth.

	18.  Addition of water in excess of evapotranspiration may cause dissolution and removal of soluble soil material.  Eventually, voids will form in the soil which will manifested at the surface as depressions.

Other soluble salts may also contribute to the loss of volume of the soil.  

Assumptions:

		* Differential subsidence is assumed to always occur, rather than an equidimensional settling.
		* Water as irrigation, leakage, septic systems, or whatever is assumed to be applied.  If no water is added to the soil, no dissolution 				occurs and therefore no subsidence.
		* Dissolution kinetics are assumed to be such that the settling is observable in our lifetimes.
		* The size of the structure has an influence on the tolerable amount of distortion due to settling.
		* The age of the structure influences the amount of damage it will sustain if differential subsidence occurs.
		* The particle size of the gypsum will influence the dissolution rate.  A generic rate is assumed here.

Description:

The wastewater considered is from municipal wastewater, food-processing plants, lagoons, and storage ponds.  Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality.  It contains domestic waste and possibly industrial waste.  It may be, although rarely is, raw sewage (untreated), or it may be wastewater that has received primary or secondary treatment.  Food-processing wastewater is the wastewater resulting from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption.  In some places, it is high in sodium and chloride.  Lagoon and storage pond effluents, as discussed here, refer to the effluents from a lagoon or storage pond that is used to treat or store food-processing wastewater, domestic wastes, or animal wastes.  Domestic wastes are very dilute, and the effluent from a facility that treats them commonly is very low in carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter.  The nitrogen content ranges from 10 to 30 mg/l.  Lagoons and storage ponds that treat animal wastes have an effluent that has a much higher concentration of these materials mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as domestic wastes.  The nitrogen content varies considerably but generally is 50 to 2,000 mg/l.  The heavy metal content generally is low; however, chemical analyses should be made prior to use.

In this process, wastewater is applied to the upper reaches of sloped land and allowed to flow across vegetated surfaces that are sometimes called terraces, to runoff collection ditches.  The length of the run generally is 150 to 300 feet.  Application rates range from 2.5 to 16.0 inches per week.  The wastewater leaves solids and nutrients to plants and soil surfaces as it flows downslope in a thin film.  Most of the water reaches the collection ditch, some is lost by evapotranspiration, and a small part percolates to the ground water.

Scope: National

The soil-rating guide is based on the treatment of the wastewater and not utilizing wastewater for irrigating of crops.  However, areas are vegetated because plants are a necessary part of the soil-plant treatment process.  Wastewater generally is applied by sprinkler or surface application methods.

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that affect absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, and the design and construction of site.  The properties that affect adsorption are soil reaction and the cation exchange capacity.  Soil reaction, salinity, and the sodium adsorption ratio are soil properties that affect plant growth and microbial activity.  Slope, permeability within a depth of about 30 inches, depth to a seasonal high water table, flooding, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, and stones are soil properties and qualities that influence design and construction.

	17.  Subsidence due to gypsum:  Addition of water in excess of evapotranspiration may cause dissolution and removal of soluble soil material.  Eventually, voids will form in the soil which will manifested at the surface as depressions.  These will collect water which will cause uneven distribution of irrigation water and exacerbate the dissolution problem.  Subsidence is estimated from the gypsum content of the soil.  Other soluble salts may also contribute to the loss of volume of the soil.  

Assumptions:

		* Differential subsidence is assumed to always occur, rather than an equidimensional settling.
		* Water as irrigation, leakage, septic systems, or whatever is assumed to be applied.  If no water is added to the soil, no dissolution 				occurs and therefore no subsidence.
		* Dissolution kinetics are assumed to be such that the settling is observable in our lifetimes.
		* The size of the structure has an influence on the tolerable amount of distortion due to settling.
		* The age of the structure influences the amount of damage it will sustain if differential subsidence occurs.
		* The particle size of the gypsum will influence the dissolution rate.  A generic rate is assumed here.

-------------------------

Refer to section 537 of the National Forestry Manual for specific soil rating criteria.

Description:

Ratings indicate the hazard or risk of ruts in the uppermost soil surface layers by operation of forest equipment.  Soil displacement and puddling (soil deformation and compaction) may occur simultaneously with rutting.

Ratings assess:

* The operation of equipment on forest sites (3-10 passes) when the soil moisture is near field capacity.

* The use of standard rubber-tired vehicles (non-flotation tires).
 
* Year-long water tables < 12.
* Soil displacement and puddling which may affect aesthetics, groundwater hydrology, and productivity of the site.

Ratings assume:

* Rutting depths usually range from 2 to 24 and depends, in part, on the weight of equipment (including carried or pulled loads) and shape and size of wheels.

* Lack of organic/vegetation surface cover.

* Conditions occurs on soil with slopes and other characteristics that allow use of ground-based equipment.

Ratings do not assess:

* Impacts of rutting on sloping sites that may channel surface water and affect hydrology.

* Frozen soil within 24 of the surface.

Rating Classes (Crisp):

* Slight - Little or no rutting.

* Moderate - Ruts are likely.

* Severe- Ruts readily."|07/19/2018 19:46:25|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666493"

* The landscape in its natural setting.
 
* Frequency and duration of flooding, ponding and depth and duration of water table.

* The use of trucks (1/2-ton to log-transport capability).

* Activities that disturb 100 percent of the soil surface area with rutting, puddling or displacement up to a depth of 18.

* Vegetation and debris is cleared from an area sufficient in width for the road before use begins.  

* Using the natural setting of the soil without cut and fill construction.  

* Slopes are less than 20 percent gradient. 

* Use occurs during customary periods of such activity for the local area.

* Roads are generally less than 1 mile in length with up to a 20-foot wide running surface.

"TX201"|"ENG - Shallow Excavations"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Shallow Excavations"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Shallow Excavations"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Shallow excavations are trenches or holes dug in the soil to a maximum depth of 5 or 6 feet.  They are used for pipelines, sewer lines, telephone and power transmission lines, basements, open ditches, grave sites, etc.  The excavations are most commonly made by trenching machines or backhoes.

Scope: National

Soil properties influence the development of building and construction sites, including the selection of the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for shallow excavations are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on the soil properties that influence ease of digging and resistance to sloughing.  Depth to bedrock or cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount of large stones influence the ease of digging, filling, and compacting.  Depth to the seasonal high water table and flooding may restrict the period when excavations can be made.  Slope influences the ease of using machinery.  Soil texture and depth to water table influence the resistance to sloughing.

              15.  Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content and the amount of traffic on the soil.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

Description:

The hazard or risk of soil loss from unsurfaced roads/trails.  Refer to the National Forestry Manual for soil rating criteria.

Ratings assess:

* The force that natural precipitation events have to dislodge and move soil materials on roads/trails and firebreaks.
 
* Activities on roads and trails that result in bare ground, compaction, and reshaping of the soil surface.

* Use by trucks, skidders, off-road vehicles and other similar equipment.

* The impact on compacted, bare road/trail surface using the representative value for slope gradient of the soil component

Ratings assume:

* Roads and trails are generally linear, continuous, and narrow ranging up to 25 feet in width.

Ratings do not assess:

* Frozen or snow-covered soil.

Rating Classes (Crisp):

* No Erosion Hazard - There is no erosion hazard associated with this activity.

* Slight - Little or no erosion is likely.

* Moderate - Some erosion is likely; occasional maintenance may be needed; simple erosion control measures needed.

* Severe - Significant erosion can be expected; roads require frequent maintenance; costly erosion control measures are needed"|07/19/2018 19:46:25|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666489"

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Dwellings W/O Basements"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Dwellings without basements are single-family houses of three stories or less without basements.  The foundation is assumed to be spread footings of reinforced concrete built on undisturbed soil at a depth of 2 feet or at the depth of maximum frost penetration, whichever is deeper.

Scope: National

Soil properties influence the development of building and construction sites, including the selection of the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for dwellings w/o basements are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on soil properties and qualities affecting the capacity of soil to support a load without movement and on those that affect excavation and construction costs.  The properties and qualities affecting load-supporting capacity without movement are the presence of a high water table, flooding, and the shrink-swell behavior and compressibility of the soils.  Compressibility is inferred from the Unified classification.  Properties influencing the ease and amount of excavation are a seasonal high water table, slope, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, and the amount and size of rock fragments.

Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of traffic on the road.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

"TX201"|"ENG - Dwellings With Basements"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Dwellings With Basements"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Dwellings With Basements"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Dwellings with basements are single-family houses of three stories or less with basements.  The foundation is assumed to be spread footings of reinforced concrete built on undisturbed soil at a depth of about 7 feet.

Scope: National

Soil properties influence the development of building and construction sites, including the selection of the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for dwellings with basements are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on soil properties and qualities affecting the capacity of soil to support a load without movement and on those that affect excavation and construction costs.  The properties affecting load-supporting capacity without movement are presence of a seasonal high water table, flooding, and the shrink-swell behavior and compressibility of the soils.  Compressibility is inferred from the Unified classification.  Properties influencing the ease and amount of excavation are flooding, a high water table, slope, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, and the amount and size of coarse fragments.

"TX201"|"ENG - Local Roads and Streets"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Local Roads and Streets"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Local Roads and Streets"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Local roads and streets are those roads and streets that have all-weather surfacing (commonly of asphalt or concrete) and that are expected to carry automobile traffic year-round.

Scope: National

The roads and streets consist of
(1) the underlying local soil material, either cut or fill, which is called ""the sub-grade"";
(2)  the base material, which may be lime-stabilized soil, cement-stabilized soil, gravel, or crushed rock;
(3) the actual road surface or street pavement, which is either flexible (asphalt), rigid (concrete), or gravel with binder in it.
They are graded to shed water, and conventional drainage measures are provided.  With the probable exception of the hard surface, roads and streets are built mainly from the soil at hand.

Soil interpretations for local roads and streets are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities that affect local roads and streets are those that influence the ease of excavation and grading and the traffic-supporting capacity.  The properties and qualities that affect the ease of excavation and grading are hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, flooding, the amount of large stones, and slope.  The properties that affect traffic-supporting capacity are soil strength as inferred from the AASHTO group index and the Unified classification, subsidence, shrink-swell behavior, potential frost action, and depth to the seasonal high water table.

Description:

Soils are rated for their use in establishing and maintaining turf for lawns and golf fairways and ornamental trees and shrubs for residential or commercial landscaping.

Scope: National

Soil interpretations for lawn, landscape, or golf fairways are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.  These ratings are based on the use of soil material at the location that may have some land smoothing.  Irrigation may or may not be needed and is not a criterion in rating.  Traps, trees, roughs, and greens are not considered as part of the golf fairway.

The soil properties and qualities considered in rating soils for lawns, landscaping, and golf fairways include those that affect growth and trafficability after vegetation is established.  The properties that affect plant growth are the content of salt, sodium, or calcium carbonate; sulfidic materials; soil reaction; depth to the water table; depth to bedrock or a cemented pan; and the available water capacity in the upper 40 inches of soil.  The properties that affect trafficability after vegetation is established are flooding, wetness, slope, stoniness, and the amount of clay, sand, or organic matter in the surface layer.

19.  Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, time of year, and the amount of working of the soil.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as "" Sanitary Landfill (Trench)"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the "" Sanitary Landfill (Trench)"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sanitary landfill (trench) is a method of disposing solid waste by placing refuse in successive layers in an excavated trench.  The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the trench.  When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the landfill.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 5 or 6 feet).  However, because trenches may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the landfill developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed trench bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the landfill.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the trench is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of refuse.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a trench-type landfill operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the fill.

16. Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content and the amount of working of the soil.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Sewage Lagoons"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Sewage Lagoons"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sewage lagoons are shallow ponds constructed to hold sewage while aerobic bacteria decompose the wastes.  Lagoons have a nearly level floor surrounded by cut slopes or embankments of compacted, relatively impervious soil material.  Relatively impervious soil for the lagoon floor and sides is desirable to minimize seepage and contamination of local ground water.  

Scope: National

Farm and ranch homesteads, outbuildings, and recreational facilities require a means to safely dispose of effluent. Sewage lagoons interpretations are a tool for guiding the user in site selection for safe disposal of liquid effluent.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or flood water.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Soil permeability is a critical property in evaluating a soil for sewage lagoons.  Most porous soils will eventually seal when being used for a sewage lagoon.  Until they do, however, the hazard of pollution is severe.  Soils that have a permeability rate that exceeds 2 inches per hour generally are too porous for the proper operation of sewage lagoons and may cause contamination.  Fractured bedrock within a depth of 40 inches may create a pollution hazard.  Bedrock and cemented pans create construction problems.

Slope must be gentle enough and the soil material must be thick enough over bedrock or a cemented pan to make smoothing practical so that the lagoon is uniformly deep throughout.

If floodwater overtops the lagoon, it interferes with the functioning of the lagoon and carries away polluting sewage before sufficient decomposition has taken place.  Ordinarily, soils susceptible to flooding have a severe limitation for sewage lagoons.  If floodwater velocities are slow and flooding is rarely deep enough to overtop the lagoon embankment, the susceptibility to flooding does not constitute a severe limitation rating.

Soils that contain a large amount of organic matter are not suitable for the floor of an aerobic lagoon.  The organic matter promotes an anaerobic rather than aerobic environment.

Depth to water table is important if it influences the water level in the lagoon.  If it does, a pollution hazard exists.  Sometimes depth to water table is disregarded if the lagoon floor is of slowly permeable soil material that is at least 4 feet thick.  Soils that contain excess rock fragments greater than 3 inches are undesirable sites because the fragments interfere with the manipulation and compaction needed to prepare the lagoon floor. 

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Depth to hard bedrock: Shallow depth to hard bedrock limits site preparation and restricts the installation of basements, shallow excavations, and lagoons.

Soil in Unified class ol or oh are not as restrictive and their interpretive rating is reduce 50%.  Soil feature considered is the rv or first Unified class of all soil layers and the most restrictive condition is reported.
	
	Property used: UNIFIED (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

High water tables raise the maintenance cost and require deeper post settings.  High shrink-swell soils require deep post settings or rock jacks to maintain vertical post alignment.  Setting posts in permanently frozen soil may cause lose of the insulation qualities of the soil and result in thermokarst topography.  Post alignment and maintaining the desired wire tension are often difficult on sandy soils due to their low strength.  Soil blowing causes maintenance problems.  Frost action results in frost-heaving of the posts.  Steep slopes affect the use power augers and the delivery of supplies.  During the wet seasons surface creep on steep slopes increases maintenance.  Soil reaction and salinity affect the type of post selected and maintenance costs.

"TX201"|"WMS - Pond Reservoir Area"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for various water management practices are developed for use in evaluating the potential of the soil for various water management practices.  These practices may involve the movement of water to or from a site, holding water on a site, or securing a water source.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  Soil limitation ratings and associated restrictive features are given for ponds and reservoir areas; embankments, dikes, and levees; and excavated ponds.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""WMS - Pond Reservoir Area"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Off-Road Motorcycle Trails"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

A pond reservoir area is an area that holds water behind a dam or embankment.  Livestock or wildlife watering facilities are examples of the potential application of pond reservoir areas.

Soil properties influence development of pond reservoir areas including site selection, structure design, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for pond reservoir areas are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

The soils best suited to this use have a low seepage potential, which is determined by permeability and depth to fractured or permeable bedrock, to a cemented pan, or to other permeable material.

Ratings are based on soil properties and qualities to act as a natural barrier against seepage into deeper layers, without regard to cutoff trenches or other features that may be installed under the pond embankment.  Excessive slope in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the pond embankment seriously reduces the storage capacity of the reservoir area.

"TX201"|"ENG - Sanitary Landfill (Area)"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Sanitary Landfill (Area)"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Sanitary Landfill (Area)"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sanitary landfill (area) is a solid-waste disposal practice where successive layers of refuse are placed on the soil surface.  The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is imported from a source away from the site.  A final cover of soil at least 2 feet thick is placed over the completed landfill.   Properties and qualities that influence trafficability and risk of pollution are the important considerations for area sanitary landfills.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Flooding is a serious problem because of the risk of washouts and pollution downstream and the difficulty of moving trucks in and out of flooded areas.  Permeability of the soil is an important consideration in all but the most arid parts of the country.  If permeability is too rapid or if fractured bedrock or a fractured cemented pan is close to the surface, the risk of contaminating the water supply by leachate is great.  A high water table may also transmit pollutants to the water supply and is likely to restrict truck movement during wet seasons.  

Slope is a consideration because of the extra grading required to maintain roads on sloping soils.  Furthermore, leachate may flow along the soil surface on sloping soils and cause difficult seepage problems in completed fills.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Flooding: Flooding has the potential to transport agricultural waste off site and pollute surface waters.  Flooding also limits building, recreational, and sanitary facility use and management of these soils.  Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

            9.  Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content and the amount of working of the soil.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Daily Cover for Landfill"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Daily Cover for Landfill"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Daily cover for landfill is the soil material that is applied daily to compacted solid waste in a sanitary landfill.  The cover material is obtained offsite, transported, and spread on the area.  The required soil characteristics for both daily and final cover materials are similar enough to share one rating.

Scope: National

Soil interpretations for Daily Cover for Landfills are a tool for guiding the user in barrow site selection and has additional application for the reclamation of some quarries, pits, and surface mine operations.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.

Suitability of a soil for use as cover is based on properties that reflect workability and the ease of digging and of moving and spreading the material over the refuse daily during both wet and dry periods.  Soils that are loamy or silty and that are free of stones are better suited than other soils.  Clayey soils may be sticky and difficult to spread, and sandy soils may be subject to soil blowing.  Slope affects the ease of excavation and of moving the cover material.  It also may affect the final configuration of the borrow area and, thus, runoff, erosion, and reclamation.

The soils selected for daily cover for landfill should also be suitable for growing plants.  They should not contain significant amounts of substances that are toxic to plants, such as a high content of sodium, salts, or lime.  They should be thick enough over bedrock, a cemented pan, or the water table so that material can be removed efficiently while leaving a borrow area that can be revegetated.  However, some damage to the borrow area is expected and plant growth may not be optimum.

18.  Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, time of year, and the amount of working of the soil.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

Soil interpretations for recreational development are to be used to guide the user in identifying and evaluating the suitability of the soil for specific recreational purposes.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  These ratings do not consider location and accessibility of the area, size and shape of the area, scenic quality, the ability of the soil to support vegetation, access to water or potential sites for water impoundment.  Nor do the ratings consider access to public sewers or the capacity of the soil to support localized sanitary facilities such as septic tank adsorption fields or sanitary landfills.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Camp Areas"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Camp Areas"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Camp areas are tracts of land used intensively as sites for tents, trailers, campers, and the accompanying activities of outdoor living.  Camp areas require site preparation such as shaping and leveling in the areas used for tents and parking areas, stabilizing roads and intensively used areas, and installing sanitary facilities and utility lines.  Camp areas are subject to heavy foot traffic and some vehicular traffic.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing camping areas and the performance of the camping area after development.  Soil properties that influence trafficability and promote the growth of vegetation after heavy use are important.  For tent or remote campsites, the limitations would be less restrictive.

Slope, stoniness, and depth to bedrock or cemented pans are the main concerns in developing camp areas.  However, areas associated with picnic areas may have steep slopes and rough terrain for aesthetic purposes.  For good trafficability, the surface of camp areas should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, permeability, and large stones.  The limitations of slow permeability and clayey surface texture are not as severe in dry regions of the country; however, silty soils may be more of a problem because they are dusty.  Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, permeability, and presence of toxic materials.  Soils that are subject to flooding are particularly hazardous for camp areas because of the danger to life and property.

             19.Dust PM10 and PM2.5 Generation: Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of traffic on the road.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

Soil interpretations for recreational development are to be used to guide the user in identifying and evaluating the suitability of the soil for specific recreational purposes.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  These ratings do not consider location and accessibility of the area, size and shape of the area, scenic quality, the ability of the soil to support vegetation, access to water or potential sites for water impoundment.  Nor do the ratings consider access to public sewers or the capacity of the soil to support localized sanitary facilities such as septic tank adsorption fields or sanitary landfills.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Paths and Trails "".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Paths and Trails "" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Paths and trails ratings apply to walking, horseback riding, and similar uses that require little or no cutting or filling.  The soils are rated based on the properties and qualities that influence trafficability and erodibility.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing paths and trails and the performance of paths and trails after development.  Stoniness, wetness, texture of the surface layer, slope, flooding, erodibility, and, in dry regions, dustiness are the main concerns in developing paths and trails.  For good trafficability, the surface of a path or trail should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.

These soil properties and qualities are.

Description:

Playgrounds are areas used intensively for games, such as baseball and football, and similar activities.  Playgrounds require a nearly level soil that is free of stones and that can withstand heavy foot traffic and still maintain adequate vegetation.  Soils ratings are based on properties that influence the cost of shaping, trafficability, and the growth of vegetation.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing playgrounds and the performance of playgrounds after development.  Slope and stoniness are the main concerns in developing playgrounds.  For good trafficability, the surface of playgrounds should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.

Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, permeability, and large stones.  The limitations of slow permeability and clayey surface texture are not as severe in dry regions of the country; however, silty soils may be more of a problem because they are dusty.  Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock, permeability, and the presence of toxic materials.

Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of traffic on the area.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

"TX201"|"URB/REC - Off-Road Motorcycle Trails"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for recreational development are to be used to guide the user in identifying and evaluating the suitability of the soil for specific recreational purposes.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  These ratings do not consider location and accessibility of the area, size and shape of the area, scenic quality, the ability of the soil to support vegetation, access to water or potential sites for water impoundment.  Nor do the ratings consider access to public sewers or the capacity of the soil to support localized sanitary facilities such as septic tank adsorption fields or sanitary landfills.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Off-Road Motorcycle Trails"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Off-Road Motorcycle Trails"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Off-road motorcycle trails are primarily for recreational use.  Trails for other off-road vehicles may have similar criteria.  Little or no preparation is done to the trail, and the surface is not vegetated or surfaced.  Considerable compaction of the soil on the trail is expected.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing off-road motorcycle trails and the performance of off-road motorcycle trails after development.  Erodibility, revegetation, trafficability, and dustiness are the main concerns in developing paths and trails.  For good trafficability, the surface of a path or trail should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Considerations for desirable off-road challenges are not included.

Soil properties considered are stoniness, slope, wetness, texture of the surface layer, and flooding.  Slope affects the soil erodibility.  Large stones affect the configuration of the trail.  Small stones affect trafficability.  Wetness and flooding affect revegetation and frequency of use.  Surface texture affects erodibility, trafficability, revegetation, and probability of dust.

These soil properties and qualities are.

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""Surface Irrigation (Level)"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for basin, paddy, level furrow, or level border irrigation systems.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

This Irrigation Application is NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO BE USED IN A REGULATORY MANNER.


Scope: Surface Irrigation Systems (Level) include basin, paddy, level furrow, or level border irrigation systems. Level surface irrigation systems are irrigation systems that use flood irrigation techniques to spread irrigation water at a specified depth across the application area.  Basin, paddy, and borders generally use external ridges or borders to confine the irrigation application while level furrow systems use furrow valleys and end blocks or border ridges to confine the irrigation application during irrigation.  With furrow irrigation the crop is usually planted on the furrow ridge. Generally, basin, paddy and level border irrigation systems are suitable for rice, small grain, pasture and forage production.  Level furrow systems are generally suited for row crops. 

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of level surface irrigation systems are depth, available water holding capacity, sodium adsorption ratio, permeability, salinity, slope, and flooding.  The soil properties and qualities that influence installation are depth, flooding and ponding.  The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, and available water holding capacity.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1.  Depth to cemented pan: Shallow depth to cemented pan limits the soil's water holding capacity and the thickness of the root zone.  Soil features considered are the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restriction kind = ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"".  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

A shallow depth to water table will also complicate the irrigation water management requirements for the site, and often increases probability of salinity problems developing.  A shallow water table will also make the soil difficult to work and produce a restricted root zone. These areas are slow to drain and can become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month in the growing season. See reference for growing season definition.

14.  Calcium Carbonate: Soils with free carbonates below the surface layer may reduce irrigation efficiency and effectiveness by increasing irrigation intake rate from what would have been estimated based on texture alone. Calcium Carbonate may restrict intake if compacted or equipment blockages from precipitation of calcium.  Free carbonates can also restrict available root zone of irrigated crops.

Summary: Soil interpretations for WMS-Surface Irrigation (Graded)"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for installation and use of graded flood or furrow irrigation systems. The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use. 

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition). If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications. 

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0). 

This Irrigation Application is NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO BE USED IN A REGULATORY MANNER.

Scope: Graded surface irrigation systems include graded border and graded furrow irrigation systems.  Graded border irrigation systems allow irrigation water to flow across the soil surface while being confined by borders.  Graded furrow irrigation systems are systems that allow irrigation water to flow down furrow valleys while the crop being irrigated is planted on the furrow ridge. Generally graded border systems are suitable for small grains while graded furrow systems are suitable for row crops.


Description: The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of graded surface irrigation systems are depth, available water holding capacity, sodium adsorption ratio, surface coarse fragments, permeability, salinity, slope, wetness, and flooding. Features that affect system performance and plant growth are salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, wetness, calcium carbonate content, and available water holding capacity.

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS- Micro-irrigation, (Above Ground)"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for irrigation systems that apply water at a slow rate near the plants or crops being irrigated. The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition). If a soil's property within 100 cm (40 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.

The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

The Drip or Trickle Irrigation interpretation was developed by the Davis, California interpretation staff in cooperation with the University of California. The original interpretation rules and criteria developed by Davis, California interpretation staff for Drip or Trickle Irrigation had been modified to meet states needs for this application in other part of the United States.  

This application is NOT DESIGNED NOR INTENDED TO BE USED IN A REGULATORY MANNER. 

Drip or trickle irrigation is the controlled application of water to supplement rainfall. The soil properties and qualities that affect design, layout, construction, management, or performance of the irrigation system are evaluated and their degree of limitation determines the final rating.

Scope:  Micro-irrigation systems are irrigation systems that generally apply frequent application of small quantities of water on or below the soil surface: as drops, tiny streams or miniature spray through emitters or applicators placed along a water delivery line.   Generally, these irrigation systems are very efficient irrigation technologies in terms of both water and energy use and are suitable for used in vineyards, orchards, windbreaks, truck crops, nurseries, and on some row crops.  This interpretation report addresses micro-irrigation systems which emit or apply water at or on the soil surface.  The Micro-irrigation, Subsurface Drip Irrigation (SDI) report addresses micro-irrigation systems that apply water below the soil surface.  

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of drip irrigation systems are depth, wetness or ponding, a need for drainage, percolation, and flooding. The soil properties and qualities that influence installation are depth, flooding and ponding. The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are the amount of salts, lime, gypsum or sodium.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1.  Depth to hard bedrock: Shallow depth to hard bedrock limits site preparation, reduces rooting depth and available water capacity, and restricts installation of underground irrigation practice components. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO BEDROCK (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		   < 50cm
			Somewhat limiting	=> 50cm and < 100cm
			Not limiting		=> 100cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF BEDROCK RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	= ""bedrock (lithic)""
			Not limiting	not = ""bedrock (lithic)""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

2.  Depth to soft bedrock: Shallow depth to soft bedrock limits site preparation, reduces rooting depth and available water capacity, and restricts installation of underground irrigation practice components. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO BEDROCK (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		   < 50cm
			Somewhat limiting	= > 50cm and < 100cm
			Not limiting		=> 100cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF BEDROCK RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	 = ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)""
			Not limiting	 not = ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

3.  Depth to cemented pan: A shallow depth to cemented pan could also reduce rooting depth and available water capacity, making it unlikely that anticipated crop response to microirrigation will be achieved.  Soil features considered are the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restriction _ kind = ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"".  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		  < 50cm
			Somewhat limiting	=> 50 and < 100cm
			Not limiting		=> 100cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
Property used: WMS - KIND OF RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	= ""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or ""petrogypsic""
			Not limiting	not = ""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or ""petrogypsic""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE HARDNESS (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	not = ""Noncemented""
			Not limiting	= ""Noncemented""
	Null hardness is assigned to the limiting class.

4.  Depth to saturated zone: A shallow depth to water table will hamper installation of irrigation pipelines, appurtenances, and earth forming that might be needed install and maintain an irrigation system.  A shallow depth to water table will also complicate the irrigation water management requirements for the site, and often increases probability of salinity problems developing.  A shallow water table will also make the soil difficult to work, restrict rooting zone, and increase risk of ground water contamination through leaching of irrigation chemical treatment constituents, nitrates, pesticides or other contaminants.  These areas are slow to drain and can become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month in the growing season. Used 90 cm as limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.  

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM DURING GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		  < 60cm
			Somewhat limiting	=>60 to < 90 cm
			Not limiting		=> 90 cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

5.  Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio are prone to develop irrigation water and rainfall infiltration restriction/reductions due to soil dispersion caused by sodium in the soil and/or soil water.  Soils with elevated SARs will require monitoring of SAR in soil and irrigation water being applied, very careful irrigation water management, possible chemical treatment.  An elevated SAR may impact expected crop response to irrigation by suppressing plant growth and will require a high degree of management. Soil feature considered is the highest sodium adsorption ratio for horizons that have any portion in the depth range 0 to 100cm.

	Property used: WMS - SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-100cm (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting		=> 20 
			Somewhat limiting	  > 6 to < 20
			Not limiting		<= 6			
	Null SAR is assigned not rated.

6.  Flooding: Flooding: Flooding frequency greater then rare has the potential to damage irrigation infrastructure, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most microirrigation systems involve a relatively high capitol investment. Most producers will want to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install the irrigation system will pay.  A frequently flooded area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Frequently flooded areas are more likely to transport nutrients, and agricultural and water treatment chemicals, which are typically applied through or in conjunction with this type of irrigation system.   Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

	Property used: WMS - FLOODING FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest, ANY MONTH (PAN) (Maximum Duration) (Modality - representative value)
	Restrictive limits:
		Very limiting		= Very frequent""
		Somewhat limiting	= ""occasional or "" frequent""
		Not limiting		= ""none"" or ""very rare"" or ""rare""
	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.

7.  Ponding: Ponding restricts or effects tillage, rooting depth, and plant growth.    Ponding may damage irrigation infrastructure, and will likely impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most irrigation systems involve a relatively high investment in money or labor or both. Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install an irrigation system will pay.  A ponding area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Soil feature considered is ponding duration any month during the growing season. 

	Property used: WMS - PONDING DURATION GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting 		= ""long"" or ""very long""
			Somewhat limiting 	= very brief or brief
			Not limiting 		= ""none""
	Null ponding duration is assigned to the Not limiting class.

8.  Excess salt: Excess salts in soil can result in corrosion of irrigation infrastructure, significant increases in irrigation system operation and maintenance requirements, and negatively impact crop response to irrigation by restricting plant growth.  Soils with elevated salinity levels will require EC monitoring of soil and irrigation water being applied.  Matching irrigated crop selection to expected salinity levels, proper leaching, and careful irrigation water management, will be required on soils with elevated salinity. A properly designed drainage system may be required to properly irrigate some soils with elevated salinity levels.  Irrigation runoff and associated subsurface drainage from these soils has potential to increase salinity levels in groundwater, downstream surface waters, and wetlands.  Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest electrical conductivity 0-100 cm.

	Property used: WMS - SALINITY MAXIMUM (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Somewhat limiting 	=> 4 
			Not limiting 		  < 4
	Null EC is assigned not rated.

9.  Low Available Water Capacity:  Soils with low available water capacities have limited potential to hold irrigation water.  Irrigation management is critical on soil with low AWC to insure adequate soil water for maximum plant growth and production.  Soil feature considered is the (available water capacity * the layer thickness) summed through a depth of 100cm or to a restrictive layer.  Used 5 cm as limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.

	Property used: WMS - AVAILABLE WATER CAPACITY IN DEPTH 0-100cm (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 5 cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 5 to < 12 cm
			Not limiting		=> 12 cm
	Null AWC is assigned to the Not rated class. 

10.  Soil Reaction:  (too acid or too alkaline) Low or High soil pH can result in corrosion of irrigation infrastructure, significantly increase in irrigation system operation and maintenance requirements, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by restricting plant growth.  Soil feature considered is the (pH) from 0 to 100cm.
	
	Property used: WMS - SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MINIMUM, 0 TO 100CM (PAN) AND SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MAXIMUM, 0 TO 100CM (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
	
			Restriction limits:  Too acid
			Very limiting		=< 3.5
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 3.5 and <5.0
			Not limiting		=> 5.0
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

		Restriction limits:  Too alkaline
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 9.0 
			Not limiting		=< 9.0
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.


11.  Calcium Carbonate: Soils with free carbonates below the surface layer may reduce irrigation efficiency and effectiveness by increasing irrigation intake rate from what would have been estimated based on texture alone. Calcium Carbonate may restrict intake if compacted or equipment blockages from precipitation of calcium.  Free carbonates can also restrict available root zone of irrigated crops.   Soil feature considered is the maximum CaCO3 equivalent (pct in thickest layer) between 25 and 100cm (10 to 40 inches) or a restrictive layer.

	Property used: WMS - CaCO3 MAXIMUM 25-100CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Somewhat limiting 	=> 50%
			Not limiting 		  < 50%
	Null CaCO3 is assigned to the Not limiting class.

12.  Seepage: Rapid permeability that allows irrigation water to percolate out of the root zone is undesirable and increase irrigation management expenses.  Permeability that maintains irrigation water within the root zone during the consumptive use period is desirable to maintain the growth and vigor of the irrigated crop. 

	Property used: WMS - KSAT MAXIMUM, 0-100CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting		  > 44.0 um/sec
			Somewhat limiting	  > 21.0 to < 44.0 um/sec 
			Not limiting		<= 21.0 um/sec
	Null Ksat is assigned not rated.

13.  Content of large stones (a): Large stone impede installation of irrigation system pipeline mains, laterals, and appurtenances.  Large stones may make O&M on buried irrigation infrastructure more difficult and may impact expected crop response to irrigation by effecting tillage, planting, and harvesting and plant growth through reduced soil available water content.  Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in the surface layer.

	Property used: WMS - FRAGMENTS > 75MM SURFACE LAYER (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		  > 35 %
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 25 % to <= 35 %
			Not limiting 		=< 25 %
	Null fragment data are assigned Not rated.

14.  Content of large stones (b): Excessive stones (rock fragments, > 10 inch in diameter) on the soil surface layer may impede installation of irrigation pipelines and appurtenances to deliver water to microirrigation (above ground) systems.   Above ground installations of main pipelines and laterals can often be used to overcome this limitation.  Above ground installations will sometimes have more varmint damage issues than below ground system delivery pipelines.  Soil feature considered is percent rock fragments > 10 inches in size on the surface soil layer.

	Property used: WMS - FRAGMENTS >=250MM ON THE SURFACE (PAN) (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Somewhat limiting	 => 5%
			Not limiting		< 5 %
	Null > 10 inch rock fragment data are assigned to the Not limiting class.

15.  Subsidence - The presence of gypsum or soluble salts in the soil, parent material, or bedrock may lead to the formation of subsidence features if the amount of irrigation water applied grossly exceeds evapotranspiration.  In humid climates, excessive irrigation on soils occuring over limestone bedrock can also experience sinkhole formation.  Soil features considered are the gypsum content of the soil and bedrock as well as the presence of limestone bedrock.


	Property used: ""LIMESTONE RESIDUUM TEST""  (Modality - and representative value)
	
	
		 Restrictive Limits:
		    Limiting		If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
		    Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    
		    
		  NOTE!!!  As the property is now written, if bedrock is not populated, a N0 is returned.
		  NOTE!!!  This base rule will be expanded to evaluate more types of bedrock.
		  
		  
	Property used: ""PARENT MATERIAL ORIGIN IS SOLUBLE SALT""  (Modality - and representative value)

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS-Sprinkler Irrigation, Close Spaced Outlets, Drops"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for installation and use of sprinkler irrigation systems equipped with close spaced outlets on drops. The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use. 

The degree of limitation is expressed as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition). If a soil's property within 100 cm (40 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. 

The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and <1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

This Irrigation Application is NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO BE USED IN A REGULATORY MANNER.

Scope: Sprinkler irrigation systems (Close Spaced Outlets, Drops) are generally linear move or center pivots equipped with low pressure spray sprinkler nozzles mounted on close spaced drops that apply water close to the ground surface.  Examples of these types of systems include Low Pressure in Canopy (LPIC), Low Energy Precision Application (LEPA), Low Elevation Spray Application (LESA), and Mid Elevation Spray Application (MESA) systems.  These systems have separate slope criteria from other sprinkler systems because of their higher application rates which increase risk of runoff and irrigation induced erosion on steeper slopes.   This type of irrigation system is generally suitable for small grains, row crops, and vegetables.

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of sprinkler irrigation systems utilizing close spaced spray nozzles on drops are depth, available water holding capacity, sodium adsorption ratio, surface coarse fragments, permeability, salinity, slope, wetness, and flooding. The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are surface texture and rocks, salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, wetness, erosion potential, and available water holding capacity.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1. Too clayey: Soil with clayey surface layer has slow intake rates with associated increased potential for translocation of applied irrigation water.  The soil becomes extremely sticky when wet and causes deep rutting, which concentrates and conveys irrigation runoff.  These soils will increase operation and maintenance requirements due to stuck and slipping wheels and resulting improper sprinkler lateral alignment. These soils may also reduce plant growth and cause the irrigation system to not produce expected benefits. Soil feature considered is the clay percentage of the surface layer.

	Property used: WMS - CLAY PERCENT SURFACE LAYER (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	 	=> 60%
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 40 % and < 60%
			Not limiting 		=< 40 %
	Null clay percentage is assigned to the Not rated class.

2. Depth to cemented pan: Shallow depth to cemented pan limits the soil's water holding capacity and the thickness of the root zone. Soil features considered are the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restriction kind = ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 50 cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 50 cm and < 100 cm
			Not limiting 		=> 100cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND

A shallow depth to water table will also complicate the irrigation water management requirements for the site, and often increases probability of salinity problems developing.  A shallow water table will also make the soil difficult to work, restrict rooting zone, increase risk of ground water contamination through leaching of nitrates, pesticides or other contaminants.  Soil feature considered is, for any month, the top depth where soil moisture status is wet or saturated any month in the growing season. Used greater than or equal to 90 cm as not limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.

An elevated SAR may impact expected crop response to irrigation by suppressing plant growth and will require a high degree of management. Soil feature considered is the highest sodium adsorption ratio for horizons that have any portion in the depth range 0 to 100 cm.

Leaching applications can be very difficult to apply without producing runoff due to high application rates associated with this type of sprinkler irrigation system. A properly designed drainage system may be required to properly irrigate some soils with elevated salinity levels.  Irrigation runoff and potential subsurface drainage during leaching applications from these soils has potential to increase salinity levels in groundwater, downstream surface waters, and wetlands.

Timing, application rates, and application methods are management tools that can be used when applying these products to soil susceptible to slow percolation.

	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

15. Calcium Carbonate: Soils with free carbonates below the surface layer may reduce irrigation efficiency and effectiveness by increasing irrigation intake rate from what would have been estimated based on texture alone. Calcium Carbonate may restrict intake if compacted or blockages of equipment from precipitation of calcium.  Free carbonates can also restrict available root zone of irrigated crops.  Soil feature considered is the maximum CaCO3 equivalent (pct in thickest layer) between 25 and 100cm (10 to 40 inches) or a restrictive layer.

In humid climates, excessive irrigation on soils occuring over limestone bedrock can also experience sinkhole formation.  Soil features considered are the gypsum content of the soil and bedrock as well as the presence of limestone bedrock.

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS-Sprinkler Irrigation"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for installation and use of sprinkler irrigation systems excluding those equipped with close spaced outlets on drops which are covered in a different interpretation report.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use. 

The degree of limitation is expressed as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition). If a soil's property within 100 cm (40 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. 

The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and <1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

This Irrigation Application is NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO BE USED IN A REGULATORY MANNER.

Scope: Sprinkler irrigation systems apply irrigation water to a field through a series of pipes and nozzles and can be either solid set or mobile.  Generally, this type of irrigation system is suitable for small grains, row crops, vegetables, and orchards. 

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of sprinkler irrigation systems are depth, available water holding capacity, sodium adsorption ratio, surface coarse fragments, permeability, salinity, slope, wetness, and flooding. The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are surface texture and rocks, salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, wetness, erosion potential, and available water holding capacity.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1. Too clayey: Soil with clayey surface layer has slow intake rates with associated increased potential for translocation of applied irrigation water.  The soil becomes extremely sticky when wet and causes deep rutting, which concentrates and conveys irrigation runoff.  These soils can increase operation and maintenance requirements due to stuck and slipping wheels and resulting improper sprinkler lateral alignment on mobile systems. These soils also reduce plant growth and prevent the sprinkler irrigation system from producing expected benefits. Soil feature considered is the clay percentage of the surface layer.

	Property used: WMS - CLAY PERCENT SURFACE LAYER (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=> 60%
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 40 % and <= 60%

	Null clay percentage is assigned to the Not rated class.

2. Depth to cemented pan: Shallow depth to cemented pan limits the soil's water holding capacity and the thickness of the root zone. Soil features considered are the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restriction kind = ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"".

A shallow depth to water table will also complicate the irrigation water management requirements for the site, and often increases probability of salinity problems developing.  A shallow water table will also make the soil difficult to work, restrict rooting zone, and increase risk of ground water contamination through leaching of nitrates, pesticides or other contaminants.

Most irrigation systems involve a relatively high investment in money or labor or both. Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install an irrigation system will pay.  A frequently flooded area would not likely provide a very stable investment.

9. Content of large stones: Large stones may impede installation of underground supply pipelines and to supply sprinkler systems trafficability and tillage, planting and harvesting of crops.  Large stones may also impact operation and management requirements of the irrigation system by damaging mobile system components and complicating pipeline and irrigation system repairs, and will impact expected crop response to irrigation by effecting tillage, planting, harvesting and plant growth through reduced soil AWC.  Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in horizons above a restrictive feature or from 0 to 100 cm deep.

13. Percs slowly: Soils with low surface hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and smectitic mineralogy have slow percolation causing excess runoff and erosion during high precipitation or irrigation events. Agri-chemical and fertilizers applied to soil's with this limitation may be removed from the site by runoff and can impacting adjacent surface waters. Timing, application rates, and application methods are management tools that can be used when applying these products to soil susceptible to slow percolation.

Calcium Carbonate may restrict intake if compacted or equipment blockages from precipitation of calcium.  Free carbonates can also restrict available root zone of irrigated crops.  Soil feature considered is the maximum CaCO3 equivalent (pct in thickest layer) between 25 and 100cm (10 to 40 inches) or a restrictive layer.

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS-Irrigation -General"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for installation and use of irrigation systems.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use. This interpretation is for non-specific irrigation methods and is intended to provide initial planning information.  If the type of irrigation system has been determined additional interpretations provide more specific information.  This interpretation does not apply if the crop planned for irrigation is rice or other crops (such as cranberries) with unique plant physiological characteristics.

The degree of limitation is expressed as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0). NOTE: Several soil criteria that result in very limited responses, do not apply when irrigating rice. This report is not applicable to basin irrigation of rice. 

The General Irrigation interpretation was developed by the Temple, Texas interpretation and irrigation engineering staff. The original interpretation rules and criteria developed by Temple, Texas interpretation staff for General irrigation has been modified to meet the need for this application in other regions of the United States.  

This application is NOT DESIGNED NOR INTENDED TO BE USED IN A REGULATORY MANNER. 

Scope: Irrigation systems are used to provide supplemental water to crops, orchards, vineyards, and vegetables in area where natural precipitation will not support desired production of crops being grown.

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in design and management are sodium adsorption ratio, depth to high water table, available water holding capacity, permeability, erosion factor, slope, calcium carbonate content, ponding, and flooding.  Soil properties and qualities that influence installation and tillage are stones, depth to bedrock or cemented pan, and depth to a high water table.  The properties and qualities that affect performance of the irrigation system are depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and soil reaction.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to irrigation.
 
CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1.  Depth to hard bedrock: Shallow depth to hard bedrock limits site preparation such as shaping and leveling, reduces rooting depth and available water capacity, and restricts installation of underground irrigation practice components. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown
in the horizon table.

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO BEDROCK (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting 		  < 50 cm
			Somewhat limiting	=> 50 cm and < 150 cm
			Not limiting 		=> 150cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF BEDROCK RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	      = ""bedrock (lithic)""
			Not limiting	not = ""bedrock (lithic)""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

2. Depth to soft bedrock: Shallow depth to soft bedrock limits site preparation such as shaping and leveling, reduces rooting depth and available water capacity, and restricts installation of underground irrigation practice components. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO BEDROCK (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		  < 50 cm
			Somewhat limiting	=> 50 cm and < 150cm
			Not limiting 		=> 150cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF BEDROCK RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	      = ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)""
			Not limiting	not = ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

3.  Depth to cemented pan: Shallow depth to cemented limits site preparation such as shaping and leveling, reduces rooting depth and available water capacity, and restricts installation of underground irrigation practice components.   Soil features considered are the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restriction kind = ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"".  Depth to restrictive feature shown in the component restrictions table must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table in NASIS. 

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
	
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		  < 50cm
			Somewhat limiting	=> 50 and < 150cm
			Not limiting		=> 150cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		 = ""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or ""petrogypsic"" 
			Not limiting		not = ""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or ""petrogypsic"" 
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE HARDNESS (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	 not = ""Noncemented""
			Not limiting 	       = ""Noncemented""
	Null hardness is assigned to the limiting class.

4.  Depth to saturated zone: A shallow depth to water table will hamper installation of irrigation pipelines, appurtenances, water control structures, and earth forming that might be needed install and maintain an irrigation system.  A shallow depth to water table will also complicate the irrigation water management requirements for the site, and often increases probability of salinity problems developing.  A shallow water table will also make the soil difficult to work, restrict rooting zone, and increase risk of ground water contamination through leaching of nitrates, pesticides or other contaminants.  These areas are slow to drain and can become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month in the growing season. Soil feature used is 60 cm depth as limiting. This limitation can sometimes be overcome with installation of a properly designed drainage system.  Used greater than or equal to 90 cm as not limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.


	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM IN GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		  < 60cm
			Somewhat limiting	=> 60 cm and <90 cm
			Not limiting		  => 90 cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
5.  Low Available Water Capacity:  Soils with low available water capacities have limited potential to hold irrigation water.  Irrigation system design and management is critical on soil with low AWC to insure adequate soil water for maximum plant growth and production.  Soil feature considered is the (available water capacity x layer thickness) summed through a depth of 150 cm or to a restrictive layer.  Used 0.05 cm/cm as limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.

	Property used: WMS - AVAILABLE WATER CAPACITY IN DEPTH 0-150cm (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 7.5 cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 7.5 to < 18cm
			Not limiting		=> 18cm
	Null AWC is assigned to the Not rated class.

6.  Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio are prone to develop irrigation water and rainfall infiltration restriction/reductions due to soil dispersion caused by sodium in the soil and/or soil water.  Soils with elevated SARs will require monitoring of SAR in soil and irrigation water being applied, very careful irrigation water management, possible chemical treatment.  An elevated SAR may impact expected crop response to irrigation by suppressing plant growth and will require a high degree of management. Soil feature considered is the highest sodium adsorption ratio for horizons that have any portion in the depth range 0 to 150cm.

	Property used: WMS - SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-150cm (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting		> 20
			Somewhat limiting	> 6 and < 20
			Not limiting		< 6
	Null SAR is assigned not rated.

7.  Flooding: Flooding frequency greater then rare has the potential to damage irrigation infrastructure, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most irrigation systems involve a relatively high investment in money or labor or both. Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install an irrigation system will pay.  A frequently flooded area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Frequently flooded areas are more likely to transport nutrients and agricultural chemicals, which are typically applied at a higher rate on irrigated land, off site to receiving surface waters.  Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

	Property used: WMS - FLOODING FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest ANY MONTH (PAN) (Maximum Duration) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		= Very frequent""
			Somewhat limiting	= frequent or ""occasional""
			Not limiting		= ""none"" or ""very rare"" or ""rare""
	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.

8.  Percs slowly: Soils with low hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) have slow percolation causing excess runoff and erosion during high precipitation or irrigation events.  Agri-chemical and fertilizers applied to soils with this limitation may be removed from the site by runoff and can impacting adjacent surface waters.  Timing, application rates, and application methods are management tools that can be used when applying these products to soil susceptible to slow percolation.  Soil feature considered is the horizon with the lowest Ksat that has any portion in the depth range 0 to 150 cm or to a restrictive layer if less then 150 cm.

	Property used: WMS - KSAT MINIMUM, 0-150CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting		=< 0.14 micrometers/second
			Somewhat limiting	  > 0.14 and < 1.40 micrometers/second
			Not limiting		=> 1.40 micrometers/second	
	Null Ksat is assigned not rated.

9. Ponding: Ponding may damage irrigation infrastructure, and will likely impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most irrigation systems involve a relatively high investment in money or labor or both. Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install an irrigation system will pay.  A ponding area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Soil feature considered is ponding duration any month during the growing season. Soil feature considered is ponding duration.  This limitation can sometimes be overcome with installation of a properly designed drainage system.  
	
	Property used: WMS - PONDING DURATION DURING GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		= ""long"" or ""very long""
			Somewhat limiting	= brief or ""very brief""
			Not limiting		= ""none""
	Null ponding duration is assigned to the Not limiting class.

10. Excess salt: Soils with elevated salinity levels will require EC monitoring of soil and irrigation water being applied.  Matching irrigated crop selection to expected salinity levels, proper leaching, and careful irrigation water management, will be required on soils with elevated salinity. A properly designed drainage system may be required to properly irrigate some soils with elevated salinity levels.  Irrigation runoff and associated subsurface drainage from these soils has potential to increase salinity levels in groundwater, downstream surface waters, and wetlands.  Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest electrical conductivity 0-150 cm.

	Property used: WMS - SALINITY MAXIMUM (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Somewhat limiting	=> 4 
			Not limiting		  < 4
	Null EC is assigned not rated.

11. Slope: Limitation due to slope is highly dependant on type of irrigation system. Moderate slopes may increase runoff and erosion, when used with surface irrigation methods and specific types of mobile sprinkler irrigation systems (LEPA, LESA, LPIC, and MESA).   LEPA, LESA, LPIC, and MESA are sprinklers equipped with low pressure spray nozzles that operate on drops.  The closer the nozzle spacing and lower the drop the greater potential for runoff and irrigation induced erosion on a given soil.  Actual limiting slopes for sprinkler irrigation systems using spray nozzles on drops would be  average slope >1% for LEPA, average slope > 3.0% for LESA; and for LIPC and MESA systems average slope > 3% and surface texture finer than loam, or > 5% and surface texture loam or coarser.  All other sprinkler systems would have limitations at >= 15%.  Surface irrigation systems would have a limitation at or above 3 % slope.  Soil feature considered is the component slope.

	Property used: WMS - SLOPE (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting 		=> 15 	
       			Somewhat limiting	   >1 and < 15			
			Not limiting 		=< 1%			
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.

12. Soil Reaction:  (too acid or too alkaline) Low or High soil pH can result in corrosion of irrigation infrastructure, significantly increase in irrigation system operation and maintenance requirements, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by restricting plant growth.    Soil feature considered is the (pH) from 0 to 100cm.
	
	Property used: WMS - SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MINIMUM, 0 TO 100CM (PAN) AND SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MAXIMUM, 0 TO 100CM (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restriction limits:  Too acid
			Very limiting		=< 3.5
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 3.5 and <5.0
			Not limiting		=> 5.0
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

		Restriction limits:  Too alkaline
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 9.0 
			Not limiting		=< 9.0
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

13.  Calcium Carbonate: Soils with free carbonates below the surface layer may reduce irrigation efficiency and effectiveness by increasing irrigation intake rate from what would have been estimated based on texture alone. Calcium carbonate may restrict intake if compacted or equipment blockages from precipitation of calcium.  Free carbonates can also restrict available root zone of irrigated crops.   Soil feature considered is the maximum CaCO3 equivalent (pct in thickest layer) between 25 and 100cm (10 to 40 inches) or a restrictive layer.

	Property used: WMS - CaCO3 MAXIMUM 25-100CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Somewhat limiting	=> 50% 
			Not limiting		  < 50 %
	Null CaCO3 is assigned to the Not limiting class.


14.  Seepage:	Rapid permeability that allows irrigation water to percolate out of the root zone is undesirable and increase irrigation management expenses.  Permeability that maintains irrigation water within the root zone during the consumptive use period is desirable to maintain the growth and vigor of the irrigated crop. Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest Ksat that has any portion in the depth range 0 to 150 cm or to a restrictive layer if less then 150 cm.
	
	Property used: WMS - KSAT MAXIMUM, 0-150CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting		  > 44.0 um/sec 
			Somewhat limiting	  > 14.0 to < 44.0 um/sec	
			Not limiting		<= 14.0 um/sec
Null Ksat is assigned to the Not limiting class.

15.  Content of large stones: Large stones may impede installation of pipelines and water control structures, irrigation land leveling and/or shaping, and construction of earthen canals, ditches, or ridges.  Large stones may also impact operation and maintenance requirements of the selected irrigation system and will impact expected crop response to irrigation by effecting tillage, planting, and harvesting and plant growth through reduced soil AWC.  Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in horizons above a restrictive feature or from 0 to 100 cm deep.

	Property used: WMS - FRAGMENTS > 75MM WEIGHTED AVE. IN DEPTH 0-100CM (PAN)      (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting 		  > 35 %
			Somewhat limiting	  > 25 % to 35 %
			Not limiting		=<25 %
Null fragment data are assigned Not rated.


16.  Content of large stones (b): Excessive stones (rock fragments, > 10 inch in diameter) on the soil surface layer may impede installation of pipelines and water control structures, irrigation land leveling and/or shaping, and construction of earthen canals, ditches, or ridges.  Large stones may also impact operation and management requirements of the selected irrigation system and will impact expected crop response to irrigation by effecting tillage, planting, harvesting, and plant growth through reduced soil AWC.   Soil feature considered is percent rock fragments > 10 inches in size on the surface soil layer.

	Property used: WMS - FRAGMENTS >=250MM ON THE SURFACE (PAN) (Modality - high, low, and representative value)

			Not limiting		<= 0.1%
	Null > 10 inch rock fragment data are assigned to the Not limiting class

17.  Subsidence - The presence of gypsum or soluble salts in the soil, parent material, or bedrock may lead to the formation of subsidence features if the amount of irrigation water applied grossly exceeds evapotranspiration.  In humid climates, excessive irrigation on soils occuring over limestone bedrock can also experience sinkhole formation.  Soil features considered are the gypsum content of the soil and bedrock as well as the presence of limestone bedrock.

The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Unpaved Local Roads and Streets"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Unpaved local roads and streets are those roads and streets that carry traffic year round but have a graded surface of local soil material or aggregate. 

Scope: National

The roads and streets consist of
(1) the underlying local soil material, either cut or fill, which is called ""the sub-grade"";
(2) the surface, which may be the same as the subgrade or may have aggrate such as crushed limestone added.

They are graded to shed water, and conventional drainage measures are provided.  These roads and streets are built mainly from the soil at hand.

Soil interpretations for local roads and streets are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities that affect local roads and streets are those that influence the ease of excavation and grading and the traffic-supporting capacity.  The properties and qualities that affect the ease of excavation and grading are hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, flooding, the amount of large stones, and slope.  The properties that affect traffic-supporting capacity are soil strength as inferred from the AASHTO group index and the Unified classification, subsidence, shrink-swell behavior, potential frost action, and depth to the seasonal high water table.  The dust generating tendacy of the soil is also considered.

	17. Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gupsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of traffic on the road.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Irrigation Disposal of Wastewater"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Irrigation Disposal of Wastewater"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

The wastewater considered in this guide is municipal wastewater and wastewater from food processing plants, lagoons, and storage ponds.  Municipal wastewater contains domestic waste and, in some areas, includes industrial waste.  It may be untreated, although this is rare, or wastewater may have received primary or secondary treatment.  Food processing wastewater is the wastewater resulting from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption.  In some places, it has a high content of sodium and chloride.  Lagoon and storage pond effluent, as discussed in this guide, refer to the effluent from facilities used to treat or store domestic wastes, wastewater from food processing, or liquid animal wastes.  The effluent from a municipal or food processing plant lagoon or storage pond commonly is very low in carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter.  The nitrogen content ranges from 10 to 30 mg/l.  The effluent from animal waste treatment lagoons or storage ponds have much higher concentrations of these materials mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as domestic wastes.  The nitrogen content varies considerably but generally is from 50 to 2,000 mg/l.  Ratings are based on the influence of existing soil properties on the use.

Scope: National

Some wastewater may cause an increase in sodicity or salinity in the soils in arid and semiarid regions but it generally does not in humid regions.  The heavy metal contents of effluents are usually low; however, chemical analyses should be made prior to use.

The soil properties and qualities need to be considered in the design, construction, management, and performance of wastewater irrigation systems.  The soil properties and qualities important in design and management are the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to a seasonal high water table, the available water capacity, permeability, wind erodibility, erosion factor, slope, and flooding.  The soil properties and qualities that influence construction are stones, depth to bedrock or cemented pan, and depth to a seasonal high water table.  The properties and qualities that affect performance of the irrigation system are depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, bulk density, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and soil reaction.  The cation exchange capacity also affects performance, and it is used here as an estimate of the capacity of a soil to adsorb heavy metals.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to irrigation.  Soils having porous bedrock can be limited by rapid water movement into and through the bedrock.  Soils having high contents of soluble salts can experience subsidence.

The soil rating guide is based on the utilization of the water for crop production and is not directed toward only the disposal or treatment of the wastewater.  Checks should be made to ensure that heavy metals, nitrogen, and other salts are not added in excessive amounts.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Low adsorption: Soils with low CEC to clay ratio have limited potential for sequestering heavy metals and other potential pollutants found in agricultural waste and sustaining vigorous plant growth.  Soil feature considered is the weighted average of the cec/clay ratio (calculated from cec and clay representative values) to a depth of 150cm or to bedrock or a cemented restrictive layer.

	19.  Addition of water in excess of evapotranspiration may cause dissolution and removal of soluble soil material.  Eventually, voids will form in the soil which will manifested at the surface as depressions.  These will collect water which will cause uneven distribution of irrigation water and exacerbate the dissolution problem.  Subsidence is estimated from the gypsum content of the soil.  Other soluble salts may also contribute to the loss of volume of the soil.  

Assumptions:

		* Differential subsidence is assumed to always occur, rather than an equidimensional settling.
		* Water as irrigation, leakage, septic systems, or whatever is assumed to be applied.  If no water is added to the soil, no dissolution 				occurs and therefore no subsidence.
		* Dissolution kinetics are assumed to be such that the settling is observable in our lifetimes.
		* The size of the structure has an influence on the tolerable amount of distortion due to settling.
		* The age of the structure influences the amount of damage it will sustain if differential subsidence occurs.
		* The particle size of the gypsum will influence the dissolution rate.  A generic rate is assumed here.

Summary: Military interpretations provide a tool for managing the impact of military training and support activities on soil and soil landscape.  Soils vary in their capacity to support these activities and the ratings reflect limitations that individual soils may have.  Restrictive soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The ratings are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, or water sources. Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less than the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Bivouac areas are tracts of land used intensively as sites for field operation centers for military activity.  Bivouac areas require such site preparation as shaping and leveling in the areas used for tents and parking areas, stabilizing roads and intensively used areas, and installing sanitary facilities and utility lines.  Bivouac areas are also subject to heavy foot traffic and some vehicular traffic.

The MIL - Bivouac Areas interpretation provides information about the soil limitations for use as a bivouac and identifies those soil properties that influence the ease of developing bivouac areas and the performance of the area after development.  Soil properties that influence trafficability and promote the growth of vegetation after heavy use are also important.  For tent or remote camp sites, the limitations would be less restrictive.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan are the main concerns in developing bivouac areas.  For good trafficability, the surface of bivouac area should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, permeability, and large stones.  The limitations of slow permeability and clayey surface texture are not as severe in dry regions of the country; however, silty soils may be more of a problem because they are dusty.  Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, permeability, and presence of toxic materials.  Soils that are subject to flooding are particularly hazardous for bivouac areas because of the danger to life and property.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  The soil interpretations for Excavations for Crew-Served Weapon Fighting Positions are designed to be used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for sites to be used and excavated weapon emplacements.  As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its present condition and does not consider present land use.  The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties for that use.
 
The soil feature(s) is identified for its affects on excavation, site preparation, and ease of maintenance.  These soil feature(s) also determines the performance to be expected after weapons have been placed and the kind and degree of future maintenance required to maintain the site and weapon readiness.  Minor soil features are not identified or considered as part of the initial rating process but could be important factors where the major soil feature restrictions are overcome through design application.  Use of the soil interpretation rating guides in the planning and evaluation process allows the user to identify and recommend site selection and to plan alternative measures that minimize impacts on the soil resource.

Description:  Excavations for Crew-Served Weapon Fighting Positions are trenches or holes dug in the soil to a maximum depth of 5 or 6 feet.  They are used for troop and weapon protection and support bases.  The excavations are most commonly made by trenching machines or backhoes.

Soil properties and qualities, limits, and restrictive features used in rating are based on the soil properties that influence ease of digging, resistance to sloughing, and weapon readiness.  Depth to bedrock or cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount of large stones influence the ease of digging, filling, and compacting.  Depth to the seasonal high water table and flooding may restrict the period when excavations can be made and can affect weapon readiness.  Slope influences the ease of using machinery.  Soil texture and depth to water table influence the resistance to sloughing.

Summary: Military interpretations provide a tool for managing the impact of military train and support activities on soil and soil landscape.  Soils vary in their capacity to support these activities and the ratings reflect limitations that individual soils may have.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, or water sources. Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 60 cm (24 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  The soil interpretations for Excavations for Individual Fighting Positions are designed to be used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for sites to be used and excavated for individual fighting emplacements.  As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its natural condition and does not consider present land use.  The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties for that use.
 
The soil feature(s) is identified for its affects on excavation, site preparation, and ease of maintenance.  These soil feature(s) also determines the performance to be expected after fighting positions have been placed and the kind and degree of future maintenance required to maintain the site and position readiness.

Use of the soil interpretation rating guides in the planning and evaluation process allows the user to identify and recommend site selection and to plan alternative measures that minimize impacts on the soil resource.

Description:  Excavations for Individual Fighting Positions are trenches or holes dug in the soil to a maximum depth of 2 or 3 feet.  They are used for troop.  The excavations are most commonly made by trenching tools and shovels.

Soil properties and qualities, limits, and restrictive features used in rating are based on the soil properties that influence ease of digging, resistance to sloughing, and position readiness.  Depth to bedrock or cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount of large stones influence the ease of digging, filling, and compacting.  Depth to the seasonal high water table and flooding may restrict the period when excavations can be made and can affect position readiness.

Summary: Military interpretations provide a tool for managing the impact of military train and support activities on soil and soil landscape.  Soils vary in their capacity to support these activities and the ratings reflect limitations that individual soils may have.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, or water sources.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non- limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 180 cm (72 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified providing the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

Scope:  The soil interpretations for Excavations for Vehicle Fighting Positions are designed to be used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for sites to be used and excavated large vehicle and weapons emplacements.  As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its present condition and does not consider present land use.  The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties for that use.

The soil feature(s) is identified for its affects on excavation, site preparation, and ease of maintenance.  These soil feature(s) also determines the performance to be expected after weapons and vehicles have been placed and the kind and degree of future maintenance required to maintain the site and weapon readiness.  Minor soil features are not identified or considered as part of the initial rating process but could be important factors where the major soil feature restrictions are overcome through design application.  Use of the soil interpretation rating guides in the planning and evaluation process allows the user to identify and recommend site selection and to plan alternative measures that minimize impacts on the soil resource.

Description:  Excavations for Vehicle Fighting Positions are trenches or holes dug in the soil to a maximum depth of 5 or 6 feet.  They are used for troop, vehicle, and weapon protection and support bases.  The excavations are most commonly made by trenching machines or backhoes.

Soil properties and qualities, limits, and restrictive features used in rating are based on the soil properties that influence ease of digging, resistance to sloughing, and weapon readiness.  Depth to bedrock or cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount of large stones influence the ease of digging, filling, and compacting.  Depth to the seasonal high water table and flooding may restrict the period when excavations can be made and can affect weapon readiness.  Slope influences the ease of using machinery.  Soil texture and depth to water table influence the resistance to sloughing.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1.  Criterion name: Clayey 35 To 80%

    Too clayey: Clayey soils may become sticky when wet and are difficult
    to compact.  Soil feature considered is the layer with the maximum

Summary: Military interpretations provide a tool for managing the impact of military training and support activities on soil and the soil landscape.  Soils vary in their capacity to support these activities and the ratings reflect limitations that individual soils may have.  Restrictive soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, or water sources.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's surface property has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  The soil interpretations for Helicopter Landing Zones are designed to be used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for sites to be used as landing zones.  As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its present condition and does not consider present land use.  The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties for that use.

The soil feature(s) is identified for its affects on site preparation and ease of maintenance.  These soil feature(s) also determines the performance to be expected after landing zones have been constructed and the kind and degree of future maintenance required to maintain the site readiness.  Minor soil features are not identified or considered as part of the initial rating process but could be important factors where the major soil feature restrictions are overcome through design application.  Use of the soil interpretation rating guides in the planning and evaluation process allows the user to identify and recommend site selection and to plan alternative measures that minimize impacts on the soil resource.

Description:  Helicopter Landing Zones are areas that are developed to land helicopters and transport troops and supplies.  Soil properties and qualities, limits, and restrictive features used in rating are based on the soil properties that influence construction, maintenance, and readiness of helicopter landing zones.  Dusty surface layer, slope, or the amount of large stones influence the development and functionality of an area for landing helicopters.  Flooding or ponding may restrict the period when the landing zone can be used.

Refer to section 537 of the National Forestry Manual for specific soil rating criteria.

Description:

The likelihood of death of naturally or artificially propagated tree seedlings, as influenced by soil characteristic, physiographic features and climatic conditions.

Ratings assess:

* The impact of soil, physiographic, and climatic conditions on the survivability of newly established tree seedlings

Ratings assume:

* Site preparation is adequate for the establishment of tree seedlings.

* Artificially propagated tree seedlings are of adequate size and     quality, are adapted to the site, are planted during a time           sufficient to assure initial root growth with respect to moisture and temperature, and proper planting techniques are employed.

* Near normal monthly and yearly climatic conditions.

Ratings do no assess:

* Effects of overstory tree canopy greater than 15 feet in height.

* Effects of adjacent competing plants less than 15 feet in height.

* Effects of seedling pests (rodent, herbivore, insect, etc.).
 
Rating Classes (Crisp):

Low - Seedlings are expected to develop normally and become established.

Moderate - Root development is sufficiently retarded to cause death of some seedlings (up to 1 in 3) and establishment of surviving seedlings is delayed.

High - Seedlings are not expected to survive (at least 2 in 3 die) without special treatment or management."|07/19/2018 19:46:25|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666491"

Soil interpretations for various water management practices are developed for use in evaluating the potential of the soil for various water management practices.  These practices may involve the movement of water to or from a site, holding water on a site, or securing a water source.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  Soil limitation ratings and associated restrictive features are given for ponds and reservoir areas; embankments, dikes, and levees; and excavated ponds.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for "" Excavated Ponds (Aquifer-fed)"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise ""Excavated Ponds (Aquifer-fed)"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

An aquifer-fed excavated pond is a body of water created by excavating a pit or dugout into a ground-water aquifer.  Excluded are ponds that are fed by surface runoff and embankment ponds that impound water 3 feet or more above the original surface.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities that affect aquifer-fed excavated ponds are depth to a permanent water table, permeability of the aquifer, and quality of water as determined by inference from the salinity of the soil.  Large stones are also considered because of their effect on the ease of excavation.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Cutbanks cave: Soils with high water table are suited for aquifer-fed ponds.  However, cutbanks may cave or slump during excavation of the pond reservoir and pose a safety concern when the soil texture is silt or texture group is sandy or texture modifier is sandy or gravelly.  This tendency is true for all soils but to a lesser degree and the interpretive model is designed to give a rating no less then .1 ""Somewhat limiting"".  Extreme care and caution should be used around cutbanks to protect from cave in injury or death.  Cutbanks caving can also reduce the life expectancy of the pond unless practices are applied to limit slumping once the reservoir is filled.  Soil feature considered is the rv or first USDA Texture modifier and class of each layer and the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month.

Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Embankments, dikes, and levees are raised structures of soil material that are constructed to impound water or protect land against overflow.  They generally are less than 20 feet high, are constructed of ""homogeneous"" soil material (without a core zone), and are compacted to medium density.  Embankments that have zoned construction (core and shell) are not considered.

Soil properties influence development of embankments, dikes, and levees including site selection, structure design, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for embankments, dikes, and levees are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

Ratings are made for the soil that may be source of material for embankment fills.  The rating is given for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 5 feet, based on the assumption that soil horizons will be mixed in loading, dumping, and spreading.  The ratings do not indicate the suitability of the undisturbed soil for supporting the embankment.  Soil properties to a depth greater than the embankment height have an effect on the performance and safety of the embankment.  Generally, deeper onsite geologic investigations must be made to determine these important properties.


Ratings are based on soil properties and qualities to act as a natural barrier against seepage into deeper layers, without regard to cutoff trenches or other features that may be installed under the pond embankment.  Excessive slope in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the pond embankment seriously reduces the storage capacity of the reservoir area.  Suitable sites may be difficult to find on slopes steeper than about 10 percent.

Embankments, dikes, and levees require soil material that is resistant to seepage, piping, and erosion and that has favorable compaction characteristics.  Organic soils are not suitable because of high compression, low strength, and unpredictable permeability.  When compacting with tamping rollers (sheepsfoot rollers) or pneumatic rollers, stones over 6 inches in size must be removed; therefore, stony soils are limited for this use.  If a water table is present, the depth of usable material and the trafficability are affected.

The content of sodium and salts affects the capability for plant growth on embankment surfaces.  These properties may also indicate dispersive soils that are highly erosive and susceptible to piping.  Soils that contain gypsum may have piping and uneven settling.

Low-density silts and clays in the supporting foundation generally have excessive settlement and low strength.  Loose soils in arid regions undergo much settlement very rapidly upon becoming saturated as water is impounded.  These soils generally do not provide adequate support for embankments.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Hard to pack: Fine textured soils high in sodium and gypsum content with high plasticity and liquid limits are difficult to compact.  These hard to pact soil are limited for use in building embankments, dikes, and levees.   The interpretive model uses the maximum sodium or gypsum rating index and adds the low compaction index.  This sum is compared to the liquid limit index and the lowest index is applied to the parent rule.

11. Dust: Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of working of the soil.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS-Constructing Grassed Waterways and Surface Drains"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for systems that involve the movement of water to or from a site.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

Scope: Grassed waterways and surface drains are natural or constructed channels and drainage practices that removing excess surface and subsurface water from agricultural land.  Generally, grassed waterways are broad and shallow and are covered with erosion-resistant grasses.  They are used to conduct surface water to outlets or surface drains at a non-erosive velocity.

Description: The soil properties and qualities that affect the construction and maintenance of grassed waterways and surface drains are large stones, wetness, slope, and depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan.  The soil properties and qualities that affect the growth of grass after construction are moisture regime, susceptibility to wind or water erosion, available water capacity, rooting depth, presence of toxic substances, such as salts or sodium, and permeability to water and air.

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS-Constructing Terraces and Diversions"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for systems that involve the movement of surface water from a site.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).

Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

Scope: Terraces and diversions are embankments or a combination of an embankment and a channel constructed across a slope.  They control erosion by diverting or storing surface runoff instead of permitting it to flow uninterrupted down the slope.  These structures are designed to convey surface water to stable outlets at a non-erosive velocity.

Description: The soil properties and qualities that influence construction are slope, large stones, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, and wetness.  Other properties and qualities that may cause problems after construction are restricted rooting depth, a high susceptibility to wind or water erosion, and restricted permeability to water and air.  A high content of gypsum may cause piping or pitting.

Summary: Wildlife habitat suitability interpretations provide a tool for habitat management.  Soils vary in their capacity to produce various plants for use as wildlife habitat and are used as habitat by specific animal species.  The ratings reflect the suitability of the soil to support specific wildlife habitat elements.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, water sources, and the presence or absence of wildlife in the area.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope: Grain and seed crops for use as food and cover for wildlife habitat, interprets the soil as a medium for growing grain and seed crops, which are a component of targeted and non-targeted of wildlife species habitat.

The ""Grain and Seed Crops for Food and Cover"" interpretation, is to be used in planning the production of nonirrigated commercial grain and other seed or vegetative producing annuals for wildlife food and cover.  The annual vegetation species that are selected are usually planted at least once each year.  The use of annual tillage may increase the potential for soil erosion and, therefore, the use of conservation practices is required to minimize the hazard.  If appropriate, the soils may receive supplemental fertilization and liming to increase vegetation growth rates and seed production.  Depending upon the objectives of the user, the plant species selection and management techniques will dictate whether the habitat will be dominantly used for food, cover, or both.  The height and structure of the vegetation species are important considerations in addressing wildlife cover relationships.

The final selection of a site and suitable annual vegetation species for use in providing food and cover for wildlife is determined by the limitation of the soil such as how it influences plant establishment, survival, growth, and vigor.  The guide identifies the soil restricting features that will have the most affect on annual vegetation species as habitat.

The interpretations provide limitation ratings and identify the dominate soil characteristics that limit the site for growing grain and seed corps.  They allow the user to plan and develop alternatives in site selection and to select the grain and seed species that best meet the wildlife habitat requirements.  The user is required to develop a list of locally adapted annual cover, grain, and seed species.

Soils that are NOT LIMITED have no restrictions to use and are favorable for locally adapted annual vegetation species that are used for wildlife habitat.  Adapted species may be grown individually or in combination with other adapted species.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has limitations for the growth of climatically adapted vegetation species and these restrictive features may limit the full potential of plant growth.  A NOT LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit establishment, growth, maintenance, or performance and, thus, affect the value of the grain and seed crop as food or cover for wildlife habitat.

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of Grain and Seed Crops for Food and Cover are surface texture, organic matter content, rock fragment, depth, available water holding capacity, wetness, ponding, flooding, permeability, slope, salts, sodium adsorption ratio, and susceptibility to erosion.  The soil properties and qualities that influence installation are depth, flooding and ponding.  The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, and available water holding capacity.

Summary: Wildlife habitat suitability interpretations provide a tool for habitat management.  Soils vary in their capacity to produce various plants for use as wildlife habitat and are used as habitat by specific animal species.  The ratings reflect the suitability of the soil to support specific wildlife habitat elements.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, water sources, and the presence or absence of wildlife in the area.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

Scope: Domestic grasses and legumes for use as food and cover for wildlife habitat interpretation, ranks the soil as a medium for growing grain and seed crops, which are a component of targeted and non-targeted of wildlife species habitat.

The ""Domestic Grasses And Legumes For Use As Food And Cover For Wildlife Habitat"" interpretation is to be used in planning the production of nonirrigated domestic grass and legume vegetation for wildlife food and cover.  The species selected are generally perennial and include some common annuals.  They are self-perpetuating after the initial stand establishment and thus will tend to minimize the long-term risk of soil erosion.  Tillage may increase the potential for soil erosion during stand establishment, and conservation practices may be required to minimize the hazard.  If appropriate, the soils may receive supplemental fertilization and liming to increase vegetation growth rates for the production of vegetative food and cover.  Depending upon the objectives of the user, the plant species selection and management techniques will dictate whether the habitat will be dominantly used for food, cover, or both.  The height and structure of the vegetation species are important considerations in addressing wildlife cover relationships.

The final selection of a site and of suitable domestic grass and legume species for use in providing food and cover for wildlife is determined by the limitation of the soil, such as how it influences plant establishment, survival, growth, and vigor.  The guide identifies the soil restricting features that will have the most affect on grass and legume species as habitat.

The interpretation provide limitation ratings and identifies the dominate soil characteristics that limits the site for growing grass and/or legumes.  It allows the user to plan and develop alternatives in site selection and to select the grass or legume species, or a combination of both species that best meets the wildlife habitat requirements.  The user is required to develop a list of locally adapted domestic grass and legume species.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no limitations and are favorable for locally adapted domestic grass and legume species that are used as wildlife habitat.  Adapted species may be grown individually or in combination with other adapted species.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has restrictions for the growth of climatically adapted plants for habitat and some restrictive features may limit the full potential of plant growth.  These conditions may restrict the selection for some of the adapted species to be grown individually or in combination with other adapted species.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit establishment, growth, maintenance, or performance and thus affect the value of grass and legume species as food or cover for wildlife habitat.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope: Irrigated Grain & Seed Crops for Food & Cover interpretation ranks the soil as a medium for growing irrigated grain and seed crops, which are a component of targeted and non-targeted of wildlife species habitat.

The ""Irrigated Grain & Seed Crops for Food & Cover"" interpretation, is to be used in planning the production of irrigated seed crops for wildlife food and cover.  The annual species selected are usually planted at least once each year.  Tillage and irrigation during the growing season may increase the potential for soil erosion.  To minimize the risk of erosion, the use of conservation practices is required.  If appropriate, the soils may receive supplemental fertilization and liming to increase vegetation and seed production.  Depending upon the objectives of the manager, the plant species selection and management techniques will dictate whether the habitat will be dominantly used for food, cover, or both.  The height and structure of the plant species are important considerations in addressing wildlife cover relationships.

The final selection of a site suitable irrigated crops use to provide food and cover for wildlife is determined by the limitation of the soil, such as how it influences plant establishment, survival, growth, and vigor.  The guide identifies the soil restricting features that will have the most effect on annual plant species as habitat.

The interpretation provides limitation ratings and identifies the dominant soil characteristics that limit the site for growing irrigated grain and seed crops.  They allow the manager to plan and develop alternatives in site selection and irrigation system and to select the grain and seed species that best meet the wildlife habitat requirements.  The manager is required to develop a list of locally adapted annual cover, grain, and seed species.

Soils that are NOT LIMITED have no restrictions to irrigated use and are favorable for locally adapted grain and seed crops that are used as wildlife habitat.  Adapted species may be grown individually or in combination with other adapted species.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has restrictions for irrigation and the growth of climatically adapted plant species and some restrictive features may limit the full potential of plant growth.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit establishment, growth, maintenance, or performance and thus affect the value of the grain and seed crop as food or cover for wildlife habitat.

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of ""Irrigated Grain & Seed Crops for Food & Cover"", are surface texture, organic matter content, rock fragment, depth, available water holding capacity, wetness, ponding, flooding, permeability, slope, salts, sodium adsorption ratio, and susceptibility to erosion.  The soil properties and qualities that influence installation are depth, flooding and ponding.  The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, and available water holding capacity.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's water holding capacity and the thickness of the root zone.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock*"".

Summary: Wildlife habitat suitability interpretations provide a tool for habitat management.  Soils vary in their capacity to produce various plants for use as wildlife habitat and are used as habitat by specific animal species.  The ratings reflect the suitability of the soil to support specific wildlife habitat elements.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, water sources, and the presence or absence of wildlife in the area.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Burrowing mammals and reptiles for use as wildlife habitat interprets the soil as a habitat component according to its potential to be used by mammals and specific species of reptiles that excavate burrows.  Burrows are considered a necessary part of specific local habitat requirements for certain targeted and non-targeted species of wildlife.  The interpretation is intended to provide guidelines in the identification and selection of sites that have the most potential for preserving, maintaining, or increasing local populations of these species.  Site identification of problem areas for control of pests, such as moles, ground squirrels, etc., is also another potential application of this guide.

The Burrowing Mammals and Reptiles interpretation is of a more general nature.  It is designed to be used in the planning process to identify areas of concern prior to the application of conservation practices.  Based upon the wildlife objectives, these areas can be avoided, practices can be adjusted to minimize damage to the burrow habitat, practices can be changed to overcome limitations by the presence of the burrows, or control measures can be used to eradicate pest species.  The guide does not take into account climate or soil temperature that may influence the presence or distribution patterns of a species.  The presence or absence of a species is determined at the local level.

The interpretation identifies the dominant soil characteristics that limit the site for burrowing mammals and reptiles.  This information allows the user to plan and develop alternatives in site selection by identifying the site that best meets the wildlife habitat requirements.  The user is required to develop a list of locally adapted wildlife species that excavate their own burrows and that utilize abandoned burrows to meet at least part of their habitat requirements.  This list may include many other mammals, reptiles, and/or bird species.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions to use and are favorable for use by locally adapted animal species as wildlife habitat.  Colonization and population densities may be above average if other habitat factors are not limiting.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has restrictions to locally adapted animal species habitat and some restrictive features may limit the use of the site by burrowing species.  Colonization and population densities may be average for the area if the other habitat requirements are met.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit establishment, maintenance, or use of the site by burrowing species.  Colonization and population densities may be restricted in the area due to the limiting factors even though all of the other species habitat requirements are met.

Description:  The final identification and selection of a site suitable for burrowing mammals, reptiles, and other species capable of utilizing abandoned burrows is determined by the limitation of the soil as it influences excavation, maintenance, and preservation of the burrows.  The soil properties and qualities important in establishment and growth of ""Burrowing Mammals and Reptiles"" are wetness, low sodium and salt content, surface texture, pH, ponding, slope, permeability, and high organic matter content.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope: Upland Deciduous Trees interprets the soil as a medium for growing deciduous trees that meet specific local habitat requirements for targeted and non-targeted species of wildlife.  Commonly, deciduous trees are established through natural processes, are seeded, or are transplanted.  In general, they require better soil conditions than conifers.

The ""WLF (WTTP)-Upland Deciduous Trees"" interpretation provides minimum soil restriction at the selection of sites for growing upland deciduous tree species as wildlife habitat and is not to reflect commercial tree growth for timber harvest.  In reality, it is not uncommon for the two land use objectives to be met at the same time.  This interpretation is general in nature and identifies the soil characteristics that limit the establishment and growth of deciduous trees.  It allows the user to plan and develop alternatives in site selection and to identify the adapted tree species that best meet the wildlife habitat requirements.  The user is required to develop a list of locally adapted tree species.  Included in the list are native or introduced species, their suitability ratings, and their ability to adapt to each restrictive feature.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions and are favorable for locally adapted deciduous trees species that are used as wildlife habitat.  Adapted species may be grown individually or in combination with other adapted species.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has restrictions for the growth of climatically adapted deciduous trees for habitat and some restrictive features may limit the full potential of plant growth.  These conditions may restrict the selection for some of the adapted species to be grown individually or in combination with other adapted species.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit establishment and growth and thus affect the value of deciduous trees for wildlife habitat.

The introduction or reestablishment of deciduous trees to meet select wildlife habitat requirements is determined by a number of factors.  These factors are landscape, climate, soil, vegetation, and time.  A limitation caused by any one of these factors can influence the adaptability, survival, growth, and vigor of a tree stand.  This interpretation addresses only those factors that relate primarily to the soil.

The interpretations rates and identifies the dominant soil characteristics that influence the site for growing deciduous trees.  They allow the user to plan and develop alternatives in site selection and deciduous trees species, or a combination of both species and site that best meets the wildlife habitat requirements.  The user is required to develop a list of locally adapted deciduous trees species.

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in establishment and growth of ""Upland Deciduous Trees"" are depth, available water holding capacity, wetness, temperature extremes and dry climates

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

Summary: Wildlife habitat suitability interpretations provide a tool for habitat management.  Soils vary in their capacity to produce various plants for use as wildlife habitat and are used as habitat by specific animal species.  The ratings reflect the suitability of the soil to support specific wildlife habitat elements.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, water sources, and the presence or absence of wildlife in the area.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope: Upland Coniferous Tree, interprets the soil as a medium for growing upland coniferous trees that meet specific local habitat requirements for targeted and non-targeted species of wildlife. The species include low stature conifers, such as yew and juniper.  Baldcypress is not included for interpretations use in this guide due to its unique water and soil moisture requirements.  Commonly, upland conifer trees are established through natural processes, are seeded, or are transplanted.  Many species of conifers often grow in soil conditions that are harsher than those required for hardwoods.

The ""WLF (WTTP)-Upland Coniferous Trees"" interpretation provides minimum soil guidelines for the selection of sites for growing upland coniferous trees as wildlife habitat and not to reflect commercial tree growth for timber harvest.  In reality, it is not uncommon for the two land use objectives to be met at the same time.

This interpretation guide is general in nature and identifies the dominant soil characteristics that limit the site for growing coniferous trees.  This information allows the user to plan and develop alternatives in site selection and to identify the adapted tree species that best meet the wildlife habitat requirements.  The user is required to develop a list of locally adapted tree species.  Included in the list are native or introduced species, their suitability ratings, and their ability to adapt to each restrictive feature.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions and are favorable for locally adapted coniferous trees species that are used as wildlife habitat.  Adapted species may be grown individually or in combination with other adapted species.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has restrictions for the growth of climatically adapted coniferous trees for habitat and some restrictive features may limit the full potential of plant growth.  These conditions may restrict the selection for some of the adapted species to be grown individually or in combination with other adapted species.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit establishment and growth and thus affect the value of coniferous trees for wildlife habitat.

Description: The introduction or reestablishment of coniferous trees to meet select wildlife habitat requirements is determined by a number of factors.  These factors are landscape, climate, soil, vegetation, and time.  A limitation caused by any one of these factors can influence the adaptability, survival, growth, and vigor of a tree stand.  The guide addresses only those factors that relate primarily to the soil.

The soil properties and qualities important in establishment and growth of ""Upland Coniferous Trees"" are depth, available water holding capacity, wetness, temperature extremes and dry climates

Summary: Wildlife habitat suitability interpretations provide a tool for habitat management.  Soils vary in their capacity to produce various plants for use as wildlife habitat and are used as habitat by specific animal species.  The ratings reflect the suitability of the soil to support specific wildlife habitat elements.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, water sources, and the presence or absence of wildlife in the area.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope: Upland Mixed Deciduous-Conifer Trees, interprets the soil as a medium for growing mixed deciduous-conifer trees that meet specific local habitat requirements for targeted and non-targeted species of wildlife. Commonly, deciduous trees are established through natural processes, are seeded, or are transplanted.  In general, better soil conditions are required for mixed stands to maintain the deciduous tree component; however, many of the conifer species adapt to harsher soil conditions.  The intent of the interpretation is to provide soil limitation guidelines for the selection of mixed deciduous-conifer tree species for growing wildlife tree habitat and not to reflect commercial tree growth for timber harvest.  In reality, it is not uncommon for the two land use objectives to be met at the same time.

This interpretation is general in nature and identifies the dominant soil characteristics that limit the site for growing mixed deciduous-conifer trees.  This information allows the user to plan and develop alternatives in site selection and identify the adapted tree species that best meet the wildlife habitat requirements.  The user is required to develop a list of locally adapted tree species.  Included in the list are native or introduced species, their suitability ratings, and their ability to adapt to each restrictive feature.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no limitations and are favorable for all locally adapted mixed deciduous-conifer trees as wildlife habitat.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has habitat limitations and some restrictive features limit its full potential.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit establishment, growth, maintenance, or performance and thus affect the value of the mixed deciduous-conifer trees as wildlife habitat.
 
Description: The introduction or reestablishment of mixed deciduous-conifer trees to meet select wildlife habitat requirements is determined by a number of factors.  These factors are landscape, climate, soil, vegetation, and time.  A limitation caused by any one of these factors can influence the adaptability, survival, growth, and vigor of a tree stand.  The guide addresses only those factors that relate primarily to the soil.  These factors include available water holding capacity, wetness, depth and temperature extremes and dry climates

Rating criteria not addressed in this guide are aspect, carbonates, cation exchange capacity, reaction (PH), salinity, and sodicity.  These properties are too variable between adapted mixed deciduous-conifer tree species and are better addressed independently at the local level when making the final selection of species.  The frequency and duration of flooding or ponding are also not considered as rating criteria.  Tree species that have specific water requirements can easily be handled in one of the other guides.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.
1.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's water holding capacity and the thickness of the root zone.

Summary: Wildlife habitat suitability interpretations provide a tool for habitat management.  Soils vary in their capacity to produce various plants for use as wildlife habitat and are used as habitat by specific animal species.  The ratings reflect the suitability of the soil to support specific wildlife habitat elements.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, water sources, and the presence or absence of wildlife in the area.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Riparian herbaceous plants for use as wildlife habitat interprets the soil as a medium for growing herbaceous plants which are adapted to soil conditions that are wetter than those common in the drier upland areas.  The soils suitable for this habitat generally occur along flood plains, depressions, bottom lands, and drainages adjacent to ephemeral, intermittent, or perennial streams.  They are either saturated with water for some period during the year or are subject to periodic overflow from ponding or flooding.  Stream scouring and material deposition on flood plains are common.  The natural regeneration of many plant species may be dictated by the timing of stream, peak flow events.

These herbaceous plant species are predominantly hydrophytic commonly and include some mesophytic plants.  The adapted vegetation components are selected to meet the specific local habitat requirements for targeted and non-targeted species of wildlife.  The guide, as shown in Table 620-52, is intended to provide minimum guidelines for the selection of sites for growing and managing herbaceous plants as riparian wildlife habitat and not to reflect commercial or livestock grazing values.

The WLF (WTTP)-Riparian Herbaceous Plants interpretation is of a general nature and identifies the dominant soil characteristics that influence the suitability of the site for growing herbaceous riparian vegetation.  This information allows the user to plan and develop alternatives in site selection and to identify the herbaceous riparian species that best meet the wildlife habitat requirements.  Selection is made from a list of locally adapted herbaceous riparian species.  Included in the list are native and introduced species, their suitability ratings, and their ability to adapt to each restrictive feature.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions to use and are favorable for all locally adapted herbaceous riparian species that are used as wildlife habitat.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has restrictions for the establishment or growth of climatically adapted herbaceous riparian species for habitat and some restrictive features limit their full potential of plant growth.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit establishment, growth, maintenance, or performance and thus affect the value of the herbaceous riparian vegetation as wildlife habitat.

Description:  The management, reestablishment, or introduction of herbaceous riparian species to meet select wildlife habitat requirements is determined by a number of factors.  The factors are landscape, climate, soil, vegetation, hydrology, and time.  A limitation caused by any one of these factors can influence the adaptability, survival, growth, and vigor of the herbaceous species.  The guide addresses only those factors that relate primarily to the soil.  It identifies the limitation and the soil restricting features that will have the most affect on the use of herbaceous riparian vegetation as wildlife habitat.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1.  Dryness:  A seasonal high water table is important to the establishment and growth of herbaceous riparian vegetation.  Herbaceous riparian vegetation that is suited to wet soil conditions is adversely affected by dry, well drained soil conditions that do not meet the physiological needs of the adapted species.  The selection of species that have root systems that can reach deeper water tables or that are adapted to drier soil conditions is desirable in establishing wildlife habitat.  Supplemental irrigation during the growing season may be required for stand establishment and maintenance.

	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=> 90cm
		Somewhat limiting	 > 30 to < 90cm
		Not limiting		=< 30cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the limiting class.

	2.  Excess humus: A high content of organic matter affects the suitability of the soil as a seedbed, seedling emergence and survival, and the stability of the soil in resisting flowing water.  Soil moisture relationships during dry periods, fertility, subsidence, and plant root characteristics are affected.
	
	Property used: WTTP-USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) SURFACE LAYER (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	    = ""fb"" or ""hm"" or ""mpt"" or ""peat"" 
		Not limiting	not = ""fb"" or ""hm"" or ""mpt"" or ""peat""
	Null USDA Texture (In-Lieu-Of) are assigned to the Not limiting class.

		Not limiting		not = ""sp"" or ""muck""  
	Null USDA Texture (In-Lieu-Of) are assigned to the Not limiting class.

	3.  Sodium content: High concentrations of exchangeable sodium cause poor physical soil conditions that restrict plant growth.  Crusting and blocked pores reduce soil permeability and prolong soil wetness.  The use of soil amendments can sometimes alleviate the problem, but it is often better to select a new site or herbaceous riparian species that are tolerant of poor aeration and low water availability.

	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		=> 31 
		Somewhat limiting	 > 12 to < 31
		Not limiting		<= 12			
		
	Null SAR is assigned not rated.

	4.  Extreme soil temperature:  Soil temperatures that are too cold cause permafrost and soil temperatures that are too cool during the growing season restrict tree, shrub, and herbaceous species growth.  The selection of native species is usually the best alternative for wildlife habitat.

This rule uses a combination of soil temperature and soil temperature class to characterize the condition EXTREME SOIL TEMPERATURE. 

	Property used: WTTP-SOIL TEMPERATURE; JULY AND AUGUST (Modality - representative value) and WTTP-TAXONOMIC TEMPERATURE CLASS (Modality - representative value)

		Not limiting		 = all others
			
	Null taxonomic temperature class is assigned to the Not rated class.
	Null soil temperature is assigned to the Not limiting class.

	5.  Prolong Flooding: Prolonged flooding results in extended periods of saturated surface soils that limit species composition.  Extended periods of flooding cause stream bank erosion, result in channel movement across the flood plain, and open the area to excessive scouring.  They influence the time of planting, seedling emergence, plant survival, and the use of any special management techniques during the growing season.  The selection and management of herbaceous riparian species that are tolerant to prolonged periods flooding, saturated soil conditions, and high velocities of water flow minimize the impact of this limitation.

	Property used: WTTP-FLOODING DURATION CLASS, Greatest Frequency (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		= ""very long""
		Somewhat limiting	= ""long""
		Not limiting		= ""none"", ""very brief"", or ""brief""
		
	Null duration is assigned to the Not limiting class.

	6.  Infrequent flooding: Flooding that occurs annually or more often is desirable for the recharge of flood plain soil and ground water.  The timing of flooding and the moisture supplied are essential elements in seedling emergence, community establishment, and continued maintenance of the riparian system.  The absence of periodic flooding affects the desirable habitat species.  The desired species may not persist and the less desirable species may replace them.  The selection of species that are adapted to drier conditions for areas where flooding is minimal is the best alternative for maintaining the vegetation community.

	Null passing #10 sieve, fragments greater then 250mm, or fragments between 75 and 250mm data are assigned to the Not rated class.

	8.  Ponding:  Ponding or standing water limits the species composition within existing vegetation communities by reducing species diversity.  Standing water influences the time of planting, seedling emergence, plant survival, and the use of any special management techniques during the growing season.  The selection and management of herbaceous riparian species that are tolerant to prolonged periods of ponding and saturated soil conditions minimize the limitation.

Summary: Wildlife habitat suitability interpretations provide a tool for habitat management.  Soils vary in their capacity to produce various plants for use as wildlife habitat and are used as habitat by specific animal species.  The ratings reflect the suitability of the soil to support specific wildlife habitat elements.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, water sources, and the presence or absence of wildlife in the area.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope: Riparian Shrubs, Vines, & Trees, interprets the soil as a medium for growing shrubs, vines, and trees that are adapted to soil conditions that are wetter than those common in the drier upland areas.  The soils suitable for this habitat generally occur along flood plains, depressions, bottom lands, and areas adjacent to springs and seeps.  They are either saturated with water for some period during the year or are subject to periodic overflow from ponding or flooding.  The natural regeneration of many species may be dictated by the timing of stream, peak flow events.  The interpretation is intended to provide minimum soil restriction guidelines for the selection of sites for growing and managing riparian shrubs, vines, and trees as wildlife habitat and not to reflect commercial or livestock grazing values.

This interpretation is general in nature and identifies the dominant soil characteristics that limit the site for growing woody riparian vegetation.  This information allows the user to plan and develop alternatives in site selection and identify the adapted woody riparian species that best meet the wildlife habitat requirements.  The user is required to develop a list of locally adapted woody riparian shrub, vine, and tree species.  Included in the list are native or introduced species, their suitability ratings, and their ability to adapt to each restrictive feature.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions to use and are favorable for all locally adapted woody riparian vegetation that are used as wildlife habitat.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has restrictions for the establishment or growth of climatically adapted woody riparian species for habitat and some restrictive features may limit their full potential of plant growth.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit establishment, growth, maintenance, or performance and thus affect the value of the woody riparian vegetation as wildlife habitat.

Description: The introduction of woody riparian species or their reestablishment to meet select wildlife habitat requirements is determined by a number of factors.  The factors are landscape, climate, soil, vegetation, hydrology, and time.  A limitation caused by any one of these factors can influence the adaptability, survival, growth, and vigor of the woody species.  The interpretation addresses only those factors that relate primarily to the soil.  It identifies the limitation and the soil restricting features that will have the most affect on the use of woody riparian vegetation as wildlife habitat.  These factors include available water holding capacity, wetness, depth, sodium and salt content, and temperature extremes and dry climates

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.
1.  Dryness:  Dryness:  Soils that are deep to a water table adversely affect wetland plants and woody riparian vegetation growth and site selection.  Wetland and riparian species are suited to wet soil conditions and these conditions are especially critical for shallow rooted species.  Soils that have a seasonal high water table are desirable because in these areas the need for supplemental water in the form of irrigation is reduced.  The management of ground and supplemental water and the selection of species that are adapted to drier soil conditions help to overcome this limitation.

	Property used: WTTP-DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=> 150cm
		Somewhat limiting	 > 90 to < 150cm
		Not limiting		=< 90cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the limiting class.

	2.  Droughty: A low available water capacity means that the ability of the soil to provide continual moisture to upland plants is lower than is necessary for establish or survive naturally.  Drought-resistant species should be planted or supplemental irrigation should be planned for stand establishment and maintenance.

	Property used: WTTP-AVAILABLE WATER CAPACITY IN DEPTH 0-100cm (Modality - high, low, representative value)
			
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=< 5cm
		Somewhat limiting	 > 5 to < 10cm
		Not limiting		 > 10cm
		
	Null awc is assigned to the Not rated class.

	3.  Sodium content: High concentrations of exchangeable sodium cause poor physical soil conditions that restrict plant growth.  Crusting and blocked pores reduce soil permeability.  The use of soil amendments can sometimes alleviate the problem, but it is often better to select a new site or select woody riparian species that are tolerant of poor aeration and low water availability.

	Null SAR is assigned not rated.

	4.  Extreme soil temperature:  Soil temperatures that are too cold cause permafrost and soil temperatures that are too cool during the growing season restrict tree, shrub, and herbaceous species growth.  The selection of native species is usually the best alternative for wildlife habitat.

This rule uses a combination of soil temperature and soil temperature class to characterize the condition EXTREME SOIL TEMPERATURE.

		Not limiting		 = all others
			
	Null taxonomic temperature class is assigned to the Not rated class.
	Null soil temperature is assigned to the Not limiting class.

	5.  Flooding: Flooding from stream overflow, runoff, or high tides for extended periods adversely affects woody riparian vegetation.  Scouring of the surface or deposition result in degradation of existing plant communities.  The frequency, timing, and duration of flooding can influence the time of planting, seedling emergence, and stand survival during the growing season.  The selection of woody riparian species that are tolerant to prolonged periods of flooding may minimize the impact of this limitation.

	Property used: WTTP-FLOODING FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest and WTTP-FLOODING DURATION CLASS, Greatest Frequency (Modality - representative value)

		Not limiting		=  null
		
	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.

	6.  Ponding:  Ponding or standing water can influence seedbed preparation, seedling emergence, and stand survival during the growing season.  Planting species that are tolerant to wet soil conditions minimizes the impact of this limitation.  Soil feature considered is ponding duration.

		Limiting	  = ""long"" or ""very long""
		Somewhat limiting = ""very brief"" or ""brief""
		Not limiting	  = ""none""
		
	Null ponding duration is assigned to the Not limiting class.

	7.  Excess salt: Soils that are deep to a water table adversely affect wetland plants, site selection, and the establishment and growth of vegetation.  Soil that have a seasonal high water table are desirable because in these areas irrigation water and irrigation frequency needed to maintain wetland conditions are reduced.  Freshwater wetland species that are suited to wet soil conditions are adversely affected by dry soil conditions.  These conditions are especially critical for shallow rooted species.  The management of irrigation water and the selection of species that are adapted to drier soil conditions help to overcome this limitation.

Summary: Wildlife habitat suitability interpretations provide a tool for habitat management.  Soils vary in their capacity to produce various plants for use as wildlife habitat and are used as habitat by specific animal species.  The ratings reflect the suitability of the soil to support specific wildlife habitat elements.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, water sources, and the presence or absence of wildlife in the area.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Freshwater wetland plants for use as wildlife habitat interprets the soil as a medium for growing wetland herbaceous vegetation and shrubs that are adapted to wet soil conditions.  Floating or submerged aquatics are excluded from use in this guide.  The soils suitable for this habitat generally occur adjacent to springs, seeps, depressions, bottom lands, marshes, or the backwater areas of flood plains, such as oxbow lakes, that are not directly affected by moving floodwaters.  Many areas are ponded for some period of time because of the accumulation of excessive moisture caused by runoff from the surrounding area.

These plant species are predominantly hydrophytic and commonly include some mesophytic plants.  The regeneration of plant species is normally through natural progression.  The introduction of exotic species to enhance the habitat is an infrequent occurrence usually due to wet soil conditions during the period of optimum planting.  Generally, management is better directed towards enhancing or propagating existing species that are adapted to the soil conditions of the site and that meet a desired habitat need.  The adapted vegetation components are selected to meet specific local habitat requirements for targeted and non-targeted species of wildlife.  The interpretation is intended to provide minimum guidelines for the selection of sites for growing freshwater wetland plants as wildlife habitat and not to reflect commercial or livestock grazing values.

The WLF (WTTP)-Freshwater Wetland Plants interpretation is of a general nature and identifies the dominant soil characteristics that restrict the site for growing freshwater wetland vegetation.  This information allows the user to identify the freshwater wetland species that best meet the wildlife habitat requirements.  Selection is made from a list of locally adapted wetland species.  Included in the list are native and introduced species, their suitability ratings, and their ability to adapt to each restrictive feature.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions to use and are favorable for all locally adapted freshwater wetland vegetation that are used as wildlife habitat.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has restrictions for the establishment or growth of climatically adapted freshwater wetland species for habitat and some restrictive features limit their full potential of plant growth.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit establishment, growth, maintenance, or performance and thus affect the value of the freshwater wetland vegetation as wildlife habitat.

Description:  The management, reestablishment, or introduction of freshwater wetland species to meet select wildlife habitat requirements is determined by a number of factors.  The factors are landscape, climate, soil, vegetation, hydrology, and time.

The interpretation addresses only those factors that relate primarily to the soil.  It identifies the limitation and the soil restricting features that will have the most affect on the use of freshwater wetland plants as wildlife habitat.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	3.  Sodium content: A high concentration of exchangeable sodium causes poor physical soil conditions that restrict plant growth.  Crusting and blocked pores reduce soil air movement and soil permeability.  The use of soil amendments can sometimes alleviate the problem, but natural species selection and management may still tend to promote the less desirable species that are tolerant to poor aeration rather than the preferred freshwater wetland vegetation.  It is often better to select a new site.

	Null SAR is assigned not rated.

	4.  Ponding:  Ponding or standing water results in extended periods of saturated surface soils.  The time and duration of standing water can influence seedling emergence and plant survival during the growing season.  The selection and management of freshwater wetland species that are tolerant to saturated soil conditions and prolonged periods of ponding may minimize the impact of this limitation.

	5.  Too acid: Soils that are too acid restrict plant growth, species composition, and the amount of preferred species.  Acid soils generally contain sulfuric acid, have low base saturation, and have the potential for aluminum and/or manganese toxicity.  The addition of soil amendments and/or the selection of species that are tolerant to acid conditions are management considerations.

Summary: Wildlife habitat suitability interpretations provide a tool for habitat management.  Soils vary in their capacity to produce various plants for use as wildlife habitat and are used as habitat by specific animal species.  The ratings reflect the suitability of the soil to support specific wildlife habitat elements.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, water sources, and the presence or absence of wildlife in the area.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Saline water wetland plants for use as wildlife habitat interprets the soil as a medium for growing saline-tolerant wetland herbaceous vegetation and shrubs that are adapted to wet soil conditions.  Floating or submerged aquatics are excluded from use in this guide.  The soils suitable for this habitat generally occur in saline-sodic affected areas adjacent to springs, seeps, depressions, bottom lands, and marshes or in the backwater areas of flood plains, such as oxbow lakes, that are not directly affected by moving floodwaters.  Many areas are ponded for some period of time because of the accumulation of excessive moisture caused by runoff from the surrounding area.

Planning and management is better directed towards enhancing or propagating existing species that are adapted to the saline-sodic soil conditions of the site and that meet a desired habitat need.  The adapted vegetation components are selected to meet specific local habitat requirements for targeted and non-targeted species of wildlife.  The interpretation is intended to provide minimum guidelines for the selection of saline sites for growing and managing saline-tolerant herbaceous vegetation and shrubs as wildlife habitat and not to reflect commercial or livestock grazing values.

The Saline Water Wetland Plants interpretation is of a more general nature.  It provides suitability ratings and identifies the dominant soil characteristics that influence the suitability of the site for growing saline water wetland vegetation.  This information allows the user to identify saline-tolerant wetland species that best meet the wildlife habitat requirements.  Selection is made from a list of locally adapted wetland species.  Included in the list are native and introduced species, their suitability ratings, and their ability to adapt to each restrictive feature.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no limitations and are favorable for all locally adapted saline-tolerant wetland vegetation that are used as wildlife habitat.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has restrictions for the establishment or growth of climatically adapted saline-tolerant wetland species for habitat and some restrictive features limit the full potential of plant growth.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit establishment, growth, maintenance, or performance of plants and thus affect the value of the saline-tolerant wetland vegetation as wildlife habitat.

Description:  The management, reestablishment, or introduction of saline-tolerant wetland species to meet select wildlife habitat requirements is determined by a number of factors.  The factors are landscape, climate, soil, vegetation, hydrology, and time.  A limitation caused by any one of these factors can influence the adaptability, survival, growth, and vigor of saline-wetland species.  The guide addresses only those factors that relate primarily to the soil.  It identifies the limitation and the soil restricting features that will have the most affect on the use of saline-tolerant wetland plants as wildlife habitat. 

The soil properties and qualities important in establishment and growth of ""Saline Water Wetland Plants"" are wetness, low sodium and salt content, surface texture, pH, ponding, and high organic matter content.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1.  Dryness:  A seasonal high water table is important to the establishment and growth of herbaceous riparian vegetation.  Herbaceous riparian vegetation that is suited to wet soil conditions is adversely affected by dry, well drained soil conditions that do not meet the physiological needs of the adapted species.  The selection of species that have root systems that can reach deeper water tables or that are adapted to drier soil conditions is desirable in establishing wildlife habitat.  Supplemental irrigation during the growing season may be required for stand establishment and maintenance.

	Property used: WTTP-DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=> 90cm
		Somewhat limiting	 > 30 to < 90cm
		Not limiting		=< 30cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the limiting class.

	2.  Excess humus: A high content of humus in the surface layer restricts or affects the use of these soils for Freshwater and Saline wetland plants.  Soil feature considered is the surface layer's USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF).
	
		
	Property used: WTTP-USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) SURFACE LAYER (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:  Soil rating is reduced by 50% under the following conditions.

		Not limiting		not = ""hm"" or ""mpt""
	Null USDA Texture (In-Lieu-Of) are assigned to the Not limiting class.

	3.  Low salt: Soils that have low concentrations of water soluble salts are not favorable to saline-tolerant species but are favorable to the growth and competition of species that are less tolerant of water-soluble salts.  This condition results in a reduction in the kind, amount, and proportion of desirable saline-tolerant species.  As a result of natural species selection and management of these sites, the desirable saline water wetland species may decrease in abundance and the less desirable freshwater wetland plants increase.

	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		 < 4 
		Somewhat limiting	=> 4 to =< 8
		Not limiting		 > 8			
		
	Null EC is assigned not rated.

	4.  Sodium content: A high concentration of exchangeable sodium causes poor physical soil conditions that help to maintain saline-tolerant vegetation communities.  Crusting and blocked pores restrict soil air movement and soil permeability.  These soil conditions reduce plant competition from the less saline-tolerant species.

	Null SAR is assigned not rated.

	5.  Ponding:  Ponding or standing water results in extended periods of saturated surface soils.  The time and duration of standing water can influence seedling emergence and plant survival during the growing season.  The selection and management of freshwater wetland species that are tolerant to saturated soil conditions and prolonged periods of ponding may minimize the impact of this limitation.
	
	Property used: WTTP-PONDING DURATION (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Somewhat limiting  = ""very long""
		Not limiting	  = ""none"", ""very brief"", ""brief"" or ""long""
		
	Null ponding duration is assigned to the Not limiting class.

	6.  Too acid: Soils that are too acid restrict plant growth, species composition, and the amount of preferred species.  Acid soils generally contain sulfuric acid, have low base saturation, and have the potential for aluminum and/or manganese toxicity.  The addition of soil amendments and/or the selection of species that are tolerant to acid conditions are management considerations.

They usually have low amounts of phosphorus, iron, manganese, boron, and zinc available to plants.  The addition of soil amendments and/or the selection of species that are tolerant to alkaline conditions are management considerations.

Summary: Wildlife habitat suitability interpretations provide a tool for habitat management.  Soils vary in their capacity to produce various plants for use as wildlife habitat and are used as habitat by specific animal species.  The ratings reflect the suitability of the soil to support specific wildlife habitat elements.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, water sources, and the presence or absence of wildlife in the area.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Irrigated saline water wetland plants for use as wildlife habitat interprets the soil as a medium for growing saline-tolerant wetland herbaceous vegetation and shrubs that are adapted to wet soil conditions.  Floating or submerged aquatics are excluded from use in this guide.  The purpose of the guide is to identify soils that have the best probability for success in maintaining the existing, naturally established, saline water marginal wetlands or in establishing new saline water wetlands, including mitigation to replace existing wetlands.  It is accomplished by managing irrigation water and by planting saline-tolerant vegetation.  The soils suitable for this habitat generally occur in saline-sodic affected areas of cropland, previously cropped areas, odd areas associated with cropland, wildlands, and marginal areas associated with existing wetlands that are not directly affected by moving floodwaters.  Not included are sites that are wet due to past irrigation and management practices.  Some areas may be subject to ponding for indefinite periods because of the accumulation of excessive moisture caused by runoff from the surrounding area.

The adapted vegetation components are selected to meet specific local habitat requirements for targeted and non-targeted species of wildlife.  This interpretation is intended to provide minimum guidelines for the selection of probable sites for the irrigation and management of saline-tolerant herbaceous vegetation and shrubs as wetland wildlife habitat and not to reflect commercial or livestock grazing values.

The Irrigated Saline Water Wetland Plants interpretation is of a more general nature.  It provides suitability ratings and identifies the dominant soil characteristics that influence the suitability of the site for irrigating and growing saline-tolerant herbaceous vegetation and shrubs.  This information allows the user to identify the sites that have the best potential for establishing saline-tolerant species that best meet the wildlife habitat requirements.  Plant selection is made from a list of locally adapted wetland species.  Included in the list are native and introduced species, their suitability ratings, and their ability to adapt to each restrictive feature.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no limitations for growing saline-tolerant wetland herbaceous vegetation and shrubs as wildlife habitat.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the irrigated site has restrictions that limit the establishment or growth of climatically adapted saline tolerant wetland species for habitat and some restrictions  may limit the full potential of plant growth.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit the establishment, growth, maintenance, or performance of irrigated plants and thus affect the value of the saline-tolerant wetland herbaceous vegetation and shrubs as wildlife habitat.

Description:  The management, reestablishment, or introduction of saline-tolerant herbaceous vegetation and shrubs to meet select wildlife habitat requirements is determined by a number of factors.  The factors are landscape, climate, soil, vegetation, and time.  A limitation caused by any one of these factors can influence the adaptability, survival, growth, and vigor of the saline water wetland plants as wildlife habitat.

The soil properties and qualities important in establishment and growth of ""Irrigated Saline Water Wetland Plants"" are wetness, low sodium and salt content, surface texture, pH, ponding, slope, permeability, and high organic matter content.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

Summary: Wildlife habitat suitability interpretations provide a tool for habitat management.  Soils vary in their capacity to produce various plants for use as wildlife habitat and are used as habitat by specific animal species.  The ratings reflect the suitability of the soil to support specific wildlife habitat elements.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, water sources, and the presence or absence of wildlife in the area.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Crawfish aquaculture for use as wildlife habitat interprets the soil for its potential to be used for shallow water impoundments necessary for aquaculture.  Crawfish culture areas have dikes that are at least 3 feet high and that are capable of maintaining water levels at 1.5 to 2.0 feet for optimum crawfish production.  The interpretation is intended to provide guidelines in the identification and selection of sites that have the best potential for implementation of aquaculture.  It is not intended to reflect potential crawfish production levels that are usually more directly related to other management techniques.

The Crawfish Aquaculture interpretation is designed to be used in the planning process to identify areas of concern prior to the application of practices.  Based on the objectives for the crawfish culture, problem areas can be avoided and practices adjusted to overcome limitations and maintain good water quality and management.  The guide does not take into account the quality of the water source used in aquaculture.  Water that has concentrations of soluble salts over .6 PPM, exchangeable sodium, or more than 3 PPM of soluble iron can affect the survivability of both the crawfish and the vegetation growth used as crawfish forage.  An additional concern is the potential for soil contamination at the site.

The interpretation provides limitation ratings and identifies the dominant soil characteristics that influence or restrict the use of the site for crawfish aquaculture.  This information allows the user to plan and develop alternatives in site selection.  Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions to use and are favorable for crawfish aquaculture.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has restrictions for crawfish aquaculture and some restricting soil features may limit site maintenance, water management, crawfish populations, and/or vegetative growth for crawfish forage.  A POORLY SUITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they severely limit the establishment and maintenance of crawfish and vegetation.  Use of the site may also require restrictive conservation practices to overcome water management or site maintenance limitations.  This rating can affect the value of the site for crawfish aquaculture.

Description:  The final identification and selection of a site suitable for crawfish aquaculture is determined by the limitation of the soil.  The limitations are the soil features that influence material available for dike construction, site maintenance, water management, or the soil chemical properties that affect crawfish and their vegetative forage.  The interpretation identifies the soil restricting features that will have the most direct impact on crawfish aquaculture.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1.  Dryness:  The absence of a seasonal high water table can affect crawfish aquaculture.  A seasonal high water table can provide a water source as well as reduce the need for additional outside water.  Shallow water tables help to reduce subsoil water losses and maintain pond depth.

	Property used: WTTP-DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=> 90cm
		Somewhat limiting	 > 60 to < 90cm
		Not limiting		=< 60cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the limiting class.

	2.  Depth to bedrock: Soils that have bedrock restrict the use of the site for crawfish aquaculture because they lack sufficient overlying material for both dike construction and aquaculture practices.  Ponding over bedrock and cemented pans results in lateral seepage and wetness problems outside the site area.

	Property used: ""WTTP-DEPTH TO BEDROCK"" (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=< 100cm
		Somewhat limiting	 > 100 to < 150cm

	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

	3.

	     	Not limiting		    = ""Noncemented""
		
	Null hardness is assigned to the limiting class.

	4.  Sodium content: High concentrations of exchangeable sodium cause poor soil conditions that restrict the growth of most plants.  They affect the establishment and growth of vegetation favored by crawfish for forage.
		
	Property used: WTTP-SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-100cm (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		 > 13

	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		= ""cryic"", ""pergilic"", or ""frigid""
		Somewhat limiting	= ""mesic""
		Not limiting		= all others
			
		Null soil temperature is assigned to the Not limiting class.

	6.  Flooding: Floodwater that overtops the dikes causes changes in the controlled aquaculture water levels, deposits sediment, and contaminates water.  Dikes can breach or erode and loss of crawfish and their vegetative forage may result.  Design and construction should consider potential floodwater depth and be of sufficient height to protect the structure during a significant flooding event.

	Property used: WTTP-FLOODING FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest and WTTP-FLOODING DURATION CLASS, Greatest Frequency (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:  Where flooding frequency class is Occasional, Frequent, or Very Frequent and flooding duration
		Limiting		= ""very long"" or ""long""
		Not limiting		=  null or is not Occasionally flooded or greater and Brief or Very Brief duration.
		
	Null frequency and duration are assigned to the Not limiting class.

	7.  Excess salt: Excess water-soluble salts restrict the growth of vegetation favored by crawfish as forage.  Concentrations of soluble salts also contaminate the ponded water and adversely affect crawfish populations.
		
	Property used: WTTP-SALINITY MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-100cm (Modality - low, high, representative value)

	 	not = ""gyp"" or ""mr"" the soil is not limited and the degree of limitation index is expressed as the number 0.

	9.  Slope: Slopes that are too steep require special practices to minimize problems with water management, structure, and soil erosion.  The maintenance of adequate crawfish aquaculture structures becomes more difficult as the slope increases.  If slope is extreme, it is better to select an alternative site.
		
	Property used: WTTP-SLOPE (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		=> 3%
		Somewhat limiting	 > 1 and < 3%
		Not limiting		=< 1%			
		
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.

	10. Too acid: Soils that are too acid restrict plant growth and thus reduce the amount of preferred vegetation.  Acid soils generally contain sulfuric acid, have low base saturation, and have the potential for aluminum and/or manganese toxicity.  Soil amendments are a management consideration.
	
	Property used: WTTP-SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER SURFACE LAYER (Modality - high, low, representative value)
				
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		=< 4.5
		Somewhat limiting	 > 4.5 to < 5.5
		Not limiting		=> 5.5
		
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

	11. Too arid: Soil that is dry most of the time may not recharge soil moisture or sustain deciduous trees during the normal growing season.  Selecting drought-resistant deciduous tree species helps to overcome this limitation.  Supplemental moisture from irrigation may be necessary to provide water for tree establishment and maintenance. 

This rule use a combination of soil taxonomic characteristics to characterize the condition TOO ARID.  The soil taxonomic characteristics that make the soil LIMITING for the condition TOO ARID are:

Summary:  Grazing lands interpretations provide a tool for rangeland and grazing management.  Soils vary in their capacity to support various rangeland habitats and to produce desirable forage and carrying capacities.  The use and management of soils for numerous rangeland practices is directly dependent on individual soil properties and characteristics and those required by the management practice.  These interpretive ratings are designed to provide the user with information about presence of soil's properties or characteristic that may limit their use and management for a specific rangeland practice.  They also guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to the management practice.  The interpretive rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, and water sources.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Fencing is the construction and maintenance of barriers for the management of animals and people.  Fences are constructed using metal or wooden posts.  This interpretation was developed for conditions where the posts are set to a depth of 2 feet or less into the soil with strands of wire suspended between the posts.  This interpretation is used to rate the ease of setting posts, maintaining the wire tension, and estimating the replacement and maintenance cost.  Excavations for wooden posts are made by power auger or hand dug, metal posts are driven into the soil.

Fencing, Post Depth (=<24 inches) interpretation is of a general nature and identifies soil features that may restrict the installation of fence posts to a depth of 24 inches.  It is designed to be used in the planning process to identify areas of concern prior to installing fencing.  Soil features that may impede digging, setting, and maintenance of fencing are identified and guide the user in fence design, construction, and maintenance considerations.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions for setting fence posts within a depth of 24 inches.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the soil has features within a depth of 24 inches that may impede digging or setting fence posts or fence maintenance.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics within a depth of 24 inches are such that they limit fence post digging or setting or fence maintenance.

Description:  Bedrock, cemented pan, and large and small stones influence the excavation of post holes and the driving of posts.  Flooding and depth to a seasonal high water table may restrict the season of construction.  Flooding also affects maintenance and replacement cost.  High water tables raise the maintenance cost and require deeper post settings.  High shrink-swell soils require deep post settings or rock jacks to maintain vertical post alignment.  Setting posts in permanently frozen soil may cause lose of the insulation qualities of the soil and result in thermokarst topography.  Post alignment and maintaining the desired wire tension are often difficult on sandy soils due to their low strength.  Soil blowing causes maintenance problems.  Frost action results in frost-heaving of the posts.  Steep slopes affect the use power augers and the delivery of supplies.  During the wet seasons, surface creep on steep slopes may increase maintenance cost.  Soil reaction and salinity affect the type of post selected and maintenance costs.

Summary:  Grazing lands interpretations provide a tool for rangeland and grazing management.  Soils vary in their capacity to support various rangeland habitats and to produce desirable forage and carrying capacities.  The use and management of soils for numerous rangeland practices is directly dependent on individual soil properties and characteristics and those required by the management practice.  These interpretive ratings are designed to provide the user with information about presence of soil's properties or characteristic that may limit their use and management for a specific rangeland practice.  They also guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to the management practice.  The interpretive rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, and water sources.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Livestock watering plastic pipe or pipelines are installed using narrow, shallow trenches at a maximum depth of 2 feet.  The excavations are most commonly made by trenching machines or plows.  Soil properties influence the development of construction sites, including the selection of the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for livestock watering pipelines are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions for pipeline installation.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the soil has features that may impede pipeline installation.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit or prohibit pipeline installation.

Description:  Ratings are based on the soil properties that influence ease of digging and resistance to sloughing.  Depth to bedrock or cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount of large stones influence the ease of digging, filling, and compacting.  Depth to the seasonal high water table and flooding may restrict the period when pipeline can be installed.  Slope influences the ease of using machinery.  Soil texture and depth to water table influence the resistance to sloughing.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Ranch Access roads ratings apply to rubber tired vehicles, walking, horseback riding, and similar uses that require minimal cutting or filling.  The soils are rated based on the properties and qualities that influence trafficability and erodibility.  Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions for ranch access roads.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the soil has features that may impede construction and maintenance of ranch access roads.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit or prohibit the construction or maintenance of ranch access roads.

Description:  Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of building access roads and the performance of access roads after development.  Stoniness, wetness, texture of the surface layer, slope, flooding, erodibility, and, in dry regions, dustiness are the main concerns in developing access roads.  For good trafficability, the surface of a path or trail should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy traffic, and not be dusty when dry.

Scope:  Chaining is commonly practiced, sometimes in combination with seeding, for rangeland restoration.  Chaining is implemented to reduce the composition of pinyon and juniper trees and sagebrush.  Chaining also helps bury seed broadcast prior to chaining or between double chainings.

Chaining is often performed with an ""Ely"" chain or other similarly modified heavy chain dragged in a loose U-shaped or J-shaped pattern between two crawler-type tractors.  The chaining interpretive ratings represent the relative physical limitations of soil factors upon use of implements suitable for chaining rangeland sites and the ability to obtain a favorable vegetative response to the treatment.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions for chaining.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the soil has features that may impede chaining.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit or prohibit chaining.

Description:  Steep slopes limit the ability to safely perform the chaining operation along the contour.  Stones and rock outcrop potentially hinder the operation of the equipment.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	
	1.  Slope: A steep slope affects soil erosion and the use of mechanical equipment.  If the slope is extreme, it may be better to select an alternative practice.

Summary:  Grazing lands interpretations provide a tool for rangeland and grazing management.  Soils vary in their capacity to support various rangeland habitats and to produce desirable forage and carrying capacities.  The use and management of soils for numerous rangeland practices is directly dependent on individual soil properties and characteristics and those required by the management practice.  These interpretive ratings are designed to provide the user with information about presence of soil's properties or characteristic that may limit their use and management for a specific rangeland practice.  They also guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to the management practice.  The interpretive rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, and water sources.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Rangeland plowing or disking is commonly practiced in combination with seeding for rangeland restoration.  Plowing or disking is used to reduce the composition of sagebrush, and to a lesser extent rabbitbrush, greasewood, and annual or perennial herbaceous plants that are considered undesirable.  This treatment also helps prepare a seedbed for subsequent seeding operations.

Rangeland plowing is usually performed with a brushland plow, wheatland-type (one-way disk) plow, or extra heavy-duty, offset disk plow.  The brushland plow's rugged construction and independently spring-loaded disks allow it to be used on rough, moderately stony or rocky sites without undue breakage.  The wheatland-type plow is best suited to gentle slopes that are relatively free of stones and rock outcrop.  The extra heavy-duty, offset disk plow is well adapted to use on compact, heavy textured soils.  The rangeland plowing/disking interpretive ratings represent the relative physical limitations of soil factors upon use of implements suitable for tilling rangeland sites and, to a lesser extent, the ability to obtain a favorable vegetative response to subsequent seeding.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions for rangeland disking.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the soil has features that may impede rangeland disking.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit or prohibit rangeland disking.

Description:  Steep slopes limit the ability to safely operate a brushland, wheatland-type, or offset disk plow along the contour.  Depth to bedrock determines the thickness of the plant growth medium and restricts the capability to do deep plowing.  Stones and rock outcrop potentially damage and hinder the operation of the equipment.  Ponding, flooding, and high water table affect the timing of tillage operations.

Scope:  Rangeland dozing or grubbing is commonly practiced in combination with seeding for rangeland restoration.  Dozing or grubbing is used to reduce the composition of woody species that are considered undesirable.  This treatment also helps prepare a seedbed for subsequent seeding operations.

Rangeland dozing is usually performed with a crawler tractor and front mounted blade used to push down trees.  Rangeland grubbing is usually performed with a crawler tractor using a stinger or chisel to undercut and lift the trees or brush out of the ground.  The crawler tractor allows these practices to be used on almost all soils where slope gradient is not limiting for safety.  These rangeland dozing/grubbing interpretive ratings represent the relative physical limitations of soil factors upon use of a crawler tractor and, to a lesser extent, the ability to obtain a favorable vegetative response to subsequent seeding.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions for rangeland dozing or grubbing.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the soil has features that may impede rangeland dozing or grubbing.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit or prohibit rangeland dozing or grubbing.

Description:  Steep slopes limit the ability to safely operate a crawler tractor.  Depth to bedrock determines the thickness of the plant growth medium and restricts the capability to do grub.

Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Rangeland planting (Mechanical Seeding) is commonly practiced in combination with vegetation control techniques to revegetate depleted rangeland.  Rangeland planting may be accomplished using a rangeland drill, broadcast seeding aerially, transplanting, or with ground equipment.

The Mechanical Seeding interpretive ratings represent the relative physical limitations of soil factors upon use of a rangeland drill and the effects of soil and climatic factors upon the probability of establishing a successful planting.

A NOT LIMITED rating indicates that a successful planting can be expected in 8 or more years out of 10.  A wide variety of grass, forb, and shrub species are well adapted to seeding on that site and a high potential forage production level can be anticipated.  The benefit/cost ratios are favorable and these sites should be given primary consideration for rangeland restoration seeding.

A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating indicates that a successful planting can be anticipated in 4 to 7 years out of 10.  A limited number of plant species are adapted to seeding on the site and a moderate potential forage production level can be achieved.  Some limitations for machinery used in seedbed preparation and planting may occur.  Benefit/cost ratios are somewhat reduced to severe, but some may still be favorable.  These soils should be given secondary consideration for rangeland restoration seeding.

A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that a successful planting can be achieved in 3 or fewer years out of 10.  Only the plant species adapted to the most rigorous environmental conditions, as indicated by the restrictive features can be seeded.  Low or very low forage production levels can be anticipated.  Equipment limitations may be severe and expensive site preparation may be necessary.  Benefit/cost ratios will be very poor.  It is recommended that these sites only be seeded for emergency watershed protection; they may even be marginal for this purpose.

Description:  Rock fragments and rock outcrop potentially damage the rangeland drill.  Steep slopes limit the ability to safely operate a rangeland drill along the contour.  High clay content reduces the effectiveness of the rangeland drill and ability to operate equipment during wet soil conditions.  Extremely sandy surface textures reduce the effectiveness of the rangeland drill.  Ponding, flooding, and high water table the timing of rangeland drill seeding by limiting access to the treatment area.

Low precipitation, permafrost, shallow rooting depth, extremely sandy surface textures, low available water capacity, abrupt textural boundary, excess salt, excess sodium, acid soils, and soil blowing reduce the probability of establishing a successful planting.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Too clayey: Clayey surface layers are slippery and sticky when wet, are slow to dry, and, when dry, are usually hard.

Summary:  Grazing lands interpretations provide a tool for rangeland and grazing management.  Soils vary in their capacity to support various rangeland habitats and to produce desirable forage and carrying capacities.  The use and management of soils for numerous rangeland practices is directly dependent on individual soil properties and characteristics and those required by the management practice.  These interpretive ratings are designed to provide the user with information about presence of soil's properties or characteristic that may limit their use and management for a specific rangeland practice.  They also guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to the management practice.  The interpretive rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, and water sources.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Prescribed burning is a restoration practice that is primarily designed to help return the natural fire cycle to the landscape.  Properly carried out on suitable sites, burning can be a very effective and cost efficient treatment method to help restore the desired composition of plant species in an ecological site, improve livestock access on heavy brush or slash sites, rejuvenate sprouting browse species and stagnant grass plants, release nutrients into the soil, improve palatability and nutrient content of forage, reduce fuel loading, and prepare an ash seedbed for artificial or natural seeding.  Burning may be combined with mechanical or chemical rangeland treatments.

Fuel ignition can be natural or artificial using hand-held drip torches, aerial ignition, and other methods.  Fire lines can be natural fuel breaks, wet-line techniques, hand constructed, or machinery constructed.

The prescribed burning interpretive ratings represent the relative limitations of soil and physiographic factors upon the ability to safely contain the fire, soil and climatic factors upon the ability to obtain a favorable vegetative response to the treatment, and risk of water and wind erosion prior to reestablishing adequate watershed cover on the treatment site.

Prescribed burning should be carefully planned and executed.  It should be carried out following a well designed prescription and burn plan under the supervision of a qualified prescribed burning team.  Burning objectives should be clearly defined and should be evaluated during post-burn assessments.  Minimizing risks to human health, safety, and property damage and containment of the burn are of paramount importance.  Fire mortality susceptibility of desirable plants also needs to be taken into consideration during prescribed burning planning.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions for prescribed burning.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the soil has features that may impede prescribed burning.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit or prohibit prescribed burning.

Description:  Low precipitation, steep slopes, low available water capacity, water erosion, and wind erosion reduce the probability of re-establishing rangeland vegetation.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Droughty: A low available water capacity means that the ability of the soil to provide continual moisture to upland plants is lower than is necessary for establish or survive naturally.

Summary:  Grazing lands interpretations provide a tool for rangeland and grazing management.  Soils vary in their capacity to support various rangeland habitats and to produce desirable forage and carrying capacities.  The use and management of soils for numerous rangeland practices is directly dependent on individual soil properties and characteristics and those required by the management practice.  These interpretive ratings are designed to provide the user with information about presence of soil's properties or characteristic that may limit their use and management for a specific rangeland practice.  They also guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to the management practice.  The interpretive rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, and water sources.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Roller chopping is commonly practiced, sometimes in combination with seeding, for rangeland restoration.  Roller chopping is implemented to reduce the size and composition of oakbrush and other mountain shrubs, and young, smaller-sized, pinyon and juniper trees.  Roller chopping may also help bury seed broadcast prior to or during treatment.

Roller chopping is performed with a cylindrical roller or drum, equipped with several full-length cutting blades, that is towed behind a crawler-type tractor.  Two roller choppers are sometimes towed in tandem and set at slightly contrasting angles.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions for roller chopping.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the soil has features that may impede roller chopping.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit or prohibit roller chopping.

Description:  Steep slopes increase the power requirements for the equipment and limit the ability to safely perform the roller chopping operation.  Stones and rock outcrop damage the blades of the roller chopper and make towing more difficult.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Droughty: A low available water capacity means that the ability of the soil to provide continual moisture to upland plants is lower than is necessary for establish or survive naturally.

Scope:  Rangeland root plowing is commonly practiced in combination with seeding for rangeland restoration.  Root plowing is used to reduce the composition of sagebrush, and to a lesser extent rabbitbrush, greasewood, and annual or perennial herbaceous plants that are considered undesirable.  This treatment also helps prepare a seedbed for subsequent seeding operations.

Rangeland root-plowing is usually performed with a plow that undercuts trees or brush .  This practice can be used on almost all soils where slope gradient is not limiting for safety.  The rangeland root-plowing interpretive ratings represent the relative physical limitations of soil factors upon use of a tractor and root-plow to remove trees and shrubs and, to a lesser extent, the ability to obtain a favorable vegetative response to subsequent seeding.

The rangeland root plowing interpretive ratings represent the relative physical limitations of soil factors upon use of implements suitable for tilling rangeland sites and, to a lesser extent, the ability to obtain a favorable vegetative response to subsequent seeding.

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions for root plowing.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the soil has features that may impede root plowing.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit or prohibit root plowing.

Description:  Steep slopes limit the ability to safely operate a root-plow along the contour.  Depth to bedrock determines the thickness of the plant growth medium and restricts the capability to do deep plowing.  Stones and rock outcrop potentially damage and hinder the operation of the equipment.  Ponding, flooding, and high water table affect the timing of tillage by limiting access to the site.  High clay content reduces effectiveness of the tillage implements.

"TX201"|"DHS - Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-Scale Event"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use for ""Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-scale Event"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (about 80 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-scale Event"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-scale Event is a method of disposing of material that has been rendered unsafe and unusable by the effects of a large-scale disaster, either natural or man-made, affecting tens of counties or parishes.  Many homes and business structures will be ruined, either by smashing or contamination.  

The assumptions are as follows.  This method is to be used to permanently dispose of material that would be hazardous to public health if left exposed in the aftermath of a major flood, fire, earthquake, wind storm, or other severe weather.  Disposal of material involved in a radiological disaster is outside of the scope of this interpretation.  Large animal disposal is addressed in another interpretation.  Time is of the essence in the disposal to avoid air quality and groundwater degradation and disease or the exacerbation of respiratory conditions, particularly with material involved in flooding.  The amount of geotechnical background work at the disposal site may not be as extensive as at a normal landfill, thus the soil criteria are stringent.  A site, such as a large parking lot, is available to field-separate the materials into several classes.  The material to be buried is expected to consist largely of lumber, broken drywall, upholstered furniture, household chemicals, electronic devices, insulation, roofing materials, pressure-treated lumber, mobile homes, and anything else not considered environmentally safe to incinerate or feasible to recycle.  This material is expected to be contaminated with mold, rodent droppings, and sediment.  Some materials retrieved from the structures, such as appliances, are expected to be recycled.  Combustible material, such as fallen trees, limbs, and lumber may be burned near the disaster area, if doing so is safe.  The ash will be disposed of at a licensed landfill.  Inert materials, such as bricks and concrete blocks, are expected to be used as fill in the local area.  Limiting the distance to the disposal site from where the material originates is considered desirable.  Access roads will need to be constructed to get to the site.  When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the landfill and the area revegetated.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 feet).  However, because excavations may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the landfill.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the trench is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of refuse.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-scale Event site it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the fill.




Criteria used:

1.  Adsorption:  Soils having a low cec or ecec may not attenuate biohazardous material from the decay process.  It is assumed that the upper 25 cm of the site will be stockpiled for use in revegetating the site.  It is also assumed that alternating layers of soil and biological materials will be placed in the excavation.

Soils having low CEC or ECEC are not able to retain some leachates.  A soil is a full member of the set of soils having low adsorption if the CEC or ECEC to clay ratio is below 0.05, a partial member between 0.05 and 0.15, and a nonmember if the cec or ecec to clay ratio is over 0.150.
	
	Property used: CLAY ACTIVITY IN DEPTH 30-200cm (Modality - low, high, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		Below 0.05 meq/100g
		Somewhat limiting	0.05-0.15 meq/100g
		Not limiting		> 0.15 meq/100g
		
	The fuzzy number is weighted by 0.25, meaning this rule cannot cause the component to be absolutely true that the site is limited for the intended land use.

			
Null clay activity is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

2.   Porous bedrock: Limestone bedrock (and other types) may have numerous solution channels that allow contaminants to enter the groundwater quickly and with no renovation.  The porous nature of the bedrock is often reflected by ""karst"" phases of map units.  Deeper soils will tend to lessen the risk of contamination.

		  Evaluation used: BEDROCK IS LIMESTONE

		  
		  Property used: LIMESTONE RESIDUUM TEST, NULL SENDS NO
		  
		  Restrictive Limits:
		    Limiting		If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
		    Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    
		    
		  NOTE!!!  As the property is now written, if bedrock is not populated, a N0 is returned.
		  NOTE!!!  This base rule will be expanded to evaluate more types of bedrock.
		  
		  
		  Evaluation used: Parent Material Origin is Soluble Salt

3.  Depth to thick/thin cemented pan: Depth to thick or thin cemented pan may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when potentially hazardous materials are buried in the soil.   Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer more then 46cm thick where restrictive kind is ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"" and restrictive feature hardness is not noncemented. If pan thickness is < 46cm then the rating is reduced by half.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

4.  Too clayey:  This rule evaluates textures from the thickest layers between 30 and 200 cm.  Textures of cl, sicl, sc, sic, and c are rated as too clayey.  If clay minerology is kaolinitic or the soil is in an aridic moisture regime the clay content is not a restrictive feature.  Clayey soils may become sticky when wet and are difficult to spread and compact.  This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes and is only partially restrictive when clay mineralogy is kaolinitic. Soil feature considered is the weighted average of clay content between 30 and 200cm or above a restrictive layer and taxonomic family mineralogy.
		
	Property used: CLAY PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM (Modality - representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		>45 percent

	Restriction limits:
		If taxonomic family mineralogy is kaolinitic then
		the soil clayey rating is reduced by multiplying by 0.5.
			
	Null taxonomic mineralogy classes are assigned Not Rated.
	
5.  Instability of excavation walls:  Under certain circumstances, the sides of an excavation may collapse.  This can be hazardous to anyone in the trench or near the edge at the time of failure.  The sloughed material may need to be removed from the trench, increasing the time needed to excavate.  The sides of the trench may need to be made to reflect the angle of repose of the material or be shored.
	
	
		A. Instability of the excavation walls can be caused by the coarseness of the soil material.

		     Not limiting	Less than 170
		     
		  (The clay content is subtracted from the sand content.  100 is added to the difference to keep the numbers positive.  This number is a sort of effective sand content, adjusting for the adhesiveness of clay.)
		     
		     
		 B.  High shrink-swell can cause instability of excavation walls.

Shallow soils may pose environmental and health risks when agricultural and municipal waste materials are applied. These soils may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when trench landfills are installed. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"" or ""bedrock (paralithic)."" Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

20.  Water Gathering Surface: Some surfaces are shaped so as to gather water.  This additional water may cause problems for land use.  Soils that are concave up and down their slope and concave across their slope are most strongly water gathering.  Soils that are concave across their slope and linear or convex up and down their slopes are less water collecting.  Soils that are linear across their slopes and concave up and down their slopes are somewhat water collecting.  Soils that are convex up and down their slopes and convex across their slopes are the least water gathering.

Water gathering (concave) surfaces can concentrate water flow and cause accelerated erosion.  Increased costs because of materials and land shaping may be needed to prevent erosion.

		  Restrictive limits:
		    Somewhat Limiting		Concave up-down, concave across surfaces
		    Slightly limiting		Concave across, linear or convex up-down
		    Not limiting		All other surface shapes

Null slope shape is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.



21.  Too acid: Soils with low pH increase metallic ion availability and restricts plant growth and re-establishing vegetation in disturbed area.  Soil feature considered is the minimum (pH) of the soil layers.
	
	Property used: SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER (Minimum) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
				
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting	 < 3.5
		Not limiting	=> 3.5
			
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

22.  Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gupsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of traffic on the road.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

Summary:  This soil interpretation is for sighting manure-stacking facilities in Texas.  Manure stacking areas are either permanent or temporary and are used to store or stack accumulations of bedded manure and/or solid manure subsequent to field spreading.  Permanent manure stacking areas are concrete bunkers or roof covered sheds that are a permanent part of the waste management system.  Temporary manure stacking areas are areas where solid manure can be stored temporarily or in emergencies, such as adverse weather conditions or unforeseen circumstances.  A temporary manure stacking area is defined as, ""An unimproved area located outside water concentration areas, areas where manure application is restricted or prohibited, and preferably located in a crop field.""  The site selection should be based on all-weather access, be near a paved road and on high ground with soil that is neither poorly nor excessively well-drained. 

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those with a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Scope:  Manure is the excrement of livestock and poultry.  The consistency of manure is labile.  It changes in storage or treatment, and it depends upon the bedding used and upon whether the manure is diluted or allowed to dry.  

The interpretation identifies the dominant soil characteristics that limit the site for temporary or permanent use as a manure stacking area.  This information allows the user to plan and develop alternatives in site selection by identifying those sites that best meets the manure stacking requirements and prevent environmental harm.  Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions to use and are favorable sites for manure stacking.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has restrictions and some restrictive features may limit the use of the site.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit or may prevent the use of the area for manure stacking.

Description: The soil-rating guide design is to maintain the manure and its mineralization byproducts on site and prevent pollution of surface and ground water.  This interpretive rule uses concepts and criteria published in the AGRICULTURAL WASTE MANAGEMENT FIELD HANDBOOK (Part 651), Chapter 5.

Soil properties and qualities considered are those that affect soil absorption, soil depth, leaching potential, runoff, and surface water features.  Each of these areas is defined in Criteria.

Criteria:

A.  Adsorptive Capacity is the capacity of the soil to adsorb and attenuate heavy metals, salts, and other detrimental manure mineralization by-products.  The mineralized manure by-products are held by the soils adsorptive capacity as represented by the soils CEC and by its absorption capacity as represented by the soils available water capacity.

Leachates from the manure stockpile are held in place and leach slowly through soils with high adsorptive capacity.  These soils have a lower risk of polluting underlying ground water then do soil with low adsorptive capacity.  Low adsorption and doughtiness define the characteristics that rate a soil as having limiting, somewhat limiting, or not limiting adsorptive capacity.  These soil characteristics are further defined as:

	1.  Low adsorption: Soils with low CEC to clay ratio have limited potential for sequestering heavy metals, organic decomposition byproducts allowing contamination of underlying aquifers.  Soil feature considered is the soil's weighted average of the cec/clay ratio (calculated from cec and clay representative values).

	Property used: ""CLAY ACTIVITY (TX)"" (Modality - representative value)
			
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=< 0.050
		Somewhat limiting	 > 0.050 to  < 0.150
		Not limiting		=> 0.150
		
	Null cec or clay is assigned to the Not rated class.

OR

	2.  Droughty: Soils with low available water capacity have limited potential for sustaining vigorous plant growth and application rates per acre should be lowered.  Soil feature considered is the (available water capacity * the layer thickness) summed through the last soil layer or to a cemented restrictive layer.

	Property used: ""AVAILABLE WATER CAPACITY (TX)"" (Modality - high, low, representative value)
			
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=< 7.5cm
		Somewhat limiting	 > 7.5 to < 15cm
		Not limiting		=> 15cm
		
	Null AWC is assigned to the Not rated class.
	
B.  Shallow soil depth such as depth to bedrock, cemented pan, and water table limits the soil's adsorptive capacity and the thickness of the biologically active zone through with manure mineralization products can percolate.  Manure stacking may pose environmental and health risks when this practice is placed on shallow soils.  Soil depth is defined as:

	1.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's water holding capacity and the thickness of the root zone.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock*"".  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	Property used: ""DEPTH TO BEDROCK (TX)"" (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=< 50cm
		Somewhat limiting	 > 50 to < 100cm
		Not limiting		=> 100cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
OR

	2.  Depth to cemented pan: Shallow depth to cemented pan limits the soil's water holding capacity and the thickness of the root zone.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

	Property used: ""DEPTH TO FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE (TX)"" (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=< 50cm
		Somewhat limiting	 > 50 and < 100cm
		Not limiting		=> 100cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: ""WTTP-KIND OF FIRST RESTRICTION"" (Modality - representative value)

	     	Not limiting	 not = ""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or ""petrogypsic"" 
		
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

AND

	Property used: ""FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE HARDNESS (TX)"" (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		not = ""Noncemented""
	     	Not limiting		    = ""Noncemented""
		
	Null hardness is assigned to the limiting class.
	
OR

	3.  Depth to saturated zone: Soils with shallow depth to a water table maybe difficult to work and have a restricted rooting zone.  These areas are slow to drain and can become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture status is wet or saturated during any month.

	Property used: ""DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM (TX)"" (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=< 60cm
		Somewhat limiting	 > 60 to < 120cm
		Not limiting		=> 120cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

C.  Leaching: Soil filtering depletes, consumes, or removes phosphates and nitrates; provides long-term storage of heavy metals; and deactivates pathogens and pesticides.  Soils suitable for use as filtering systems have infiltration and permeability slow enough to allow adequate time for purification of water percolating through the soil.  Soil characteristics used to descript soil filtering are:

	1.  Leaching limitation: Soil's in Hydrologic Group A or dual groups have high intake rates or a water table near the surface.  These soils have potential leaching limitations and manure effluent leaching into the soil or into ground water is a concern.  Soil feature considered is hydrologic soil group.

	Property used: HYDROLOGIC SOIL GROUP (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Leaching limitation	= a, a/d, b/d, c/d
		Not limiting		= b, c, d
		

	Null Hydrologic Group is assigned to the Not rated class.
	
OR

	2.  Seepage: High permeability allows excessive movement of water through the soil and has poor filtering capacity.  

		
	Property used: ""KSAT MAXIMUM, BELOW THE SURFACE OR FIRST RESTRICTION (TX)"" (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		=> 42.0 um/sec
		Somewhat limiting	 > 14 to < 42.0 um/sec 
		Not limiting		<= 14 um/sec
		
	Null Ksat is assigned not rated.
	
D.  Runoff: is that portion of precipitation or irrigation which does not infiltrate into the soil, but is removed from the area by overland flow to streams, lakes, ponds, or wetlands.  Soil slope and slow surface permeability are soil characteristics used to describe potential runoff.

	1.  Slope: Steep slopes impede the operation of application or installation equipment and may require specialized equipment or system design and construction to overcome the slope limitations.  Soil feature considered is the component slope.
		
	Property used: ""SLOPE (TX)"" (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		=> 15%
		Somewhat limiting	 > 8 and < 15%
		Not limiting		=< 8%			
		
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.

AVERAGE

	2.  Percs slowly: The slow movement of water through the surface soil increases runoff potential.
		
	Property used: ""KSAT, MINIMUM IN DEPTH 0-25CM (TX)"" (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Very limited	=< 1.4 micrometers/second
		Limited		 > 1.4 and < 14 micrometers/second
		Not limiting	=> 14 micrometers/second	
		
	Null Ksat is assigned to the not limiting class.
	
E.  Surface Water: Flooding is the temporary covering of the soil surface by flowing water.  Flooding events transport materials for manure stacking sites and deposit these materials in streams, rivers, lakes, and other surface water bodies.  By contrast, Ponding is standing water in a closed depression that is removed only by percolation, transpiration, or evaporation.

Manure stacking sites should avoid soil that flood or if temporary, be used during periods of the year when the probability of flooding is low.  Sites that are ponded have a very high potential for contaminating the ponded surface water and should be avoided.

Soil features considered are maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months, ponding or both.

	Property used: ""FLOODING FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest (TX)"" (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		= ""frequent"" or""very frequent"" 
		Somewhat limiting	= ""rare"" or ""occasional""
		Not limiting		= ""none"" or ""very rare""

OR

	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	 = ""very brief"" or ""brief"" or ""long"" or ""very long""
		Not limiting	 = ""none""
		
	Null ponding duration is assigned to the Not limiting class."|06/03/2009 15:52:21|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666387"

Summary:  This soil interpretation indexes soil limitations for the application and sequestration of phosphorus or phosphorus mineralization materials.  The characteristics of the site and soils where phosphorus are being applied are important in the sequestering phosphorus and phosphorus mineralization by-products.  Non-limiting site and soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those with a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Scope:  The Phosphorus Loading Index assesses a site and its respective soils for their ability to sequester heavy application rates of phosphorus and/or phosphorus mineralization by-products.  Environmental impacts and keeping the phosphorus on site are the primary issue addressed.

The interpretation identifies the dominant soil characteristics that limits or restricts phosphorus applications.  This information allows the user to plan and develop alternatives in site selection by identifying those soils that are least limiting for the application of phosphorus.  Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no restrictions to use and are favorable phosphorus application.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has restrictions and some restrictive features may limit the use of these soils.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit or may prevent the use of the soils for sequestering phosphorus.

Description: The soil-rating guide design is to maintain and sequester phosphorus and phosphorus mineralization byproducts on site and prevent pollution of surface.

Soil properties and qualities considered are those that affect soil absorption, soil depth, runoff, and surface water features.  Each of these areas is defined in Criteria.

Criteria:

A.  The Phosphorus Site Features (TX) sub-rule describes site characteristics that affect the storage and movement of phosphorus from the site and/or into the soil.

The site characteristics considered by this interpretive rule are depth to bedrock, cemented pan, or water table; flooding; ponding; or slope.  Each of these site characteristics is assigned an index value between 1 and 0.  Sites having values of 1 have the highest limitations effecting the storage or off-site movement of phosphorus when applied to these sites.  Sites with values of 0 are not limited by site characteristics.  Index values between 0 and 1 are somewhat limited and that limitation is reflected in the magnitude of the site index number.

Background

Composting: The Process of Biological Degradation

Biological degradation of organic materials forms the basis for composting.  This biological process depends on the active metabolism of microorganisms in a suitable micro-environment. The six critical factors for the transformation of organic materials into compost are microorganisms, heat, air, water, carbon, and nitrogen.

The microorganisms that carry out biological degradation for composting often are found in the soil or on the surface of leaves.  These microorganisms thrive in a surface or subsurface microclimate with free circulation of air, free flow of water, and a temperature well above freezing. The microorganisms also require carbon as food for energy and growth, as well as nitrogen for protein and rebuilding cells.

Composting facilities are designed to provide these six critical factors in relative proportions so that the process of biological degradation is sustained.  Deficits in any of the critical factors, or imbalances among them, may result in extremely slow composting or a dormant composting system. Mixing of materials also redistributes heat, air, and water and will speed the process of biological degradation. Large facilities may provide mechanical mixing of the compost materials. Smaller facilities may rely on manual turning of the materials or may add some materials that are too large to compost in order to create channels for air flow through the pile. 

Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Mean Annual Air Temperature (MAAT) are measures of the soil micro-climate that affects the rate of composting.  Both MAP and MAAT are available from the soil survey database.  Composting is most rapid in warm, moist areas that generally have MAP between 450 and 1250 mm together with MAAT between 5 and 10 degrees Celsius.  The optimal temperature inside the compost pile is 10 to 15.5 degrees Celsius. In colder areas the rate of composting may be increased by insulating the compost pile on all sides with an extra layer of high carbon materials such as hay or newspaper. To avoid extreme cold or rainforest conditions, the composting may be done inside a protected area or a building.  The optimal moisture for composting is field capacity, or freely drained but moist. Moisture may need to be added to the compost pile especially if the organic materials are dry such as chipped lumber. 

The ratio of carbon to nitrogen in the organic materials is perhaps the hardest part of the process to regulate.  Active compost piles need a carbon to nitrogen ratio of about 30:1 (30 units of carbon to 1 unit of nitrogen). Many common materials such as leaves and lumber are high in carbon and require balanced inputs of materials that are high in nitrogen such as coffee grounds or manures and urines.  Often the materials high in nitrogen are less available or more difficult to transport to the composting site. Materials intended for composting may vary in their carbon to nitrogen ratio due to many factors and testing of materials is recommended before large scale operations begin. A few C:N examples are given in table 1.

Publications (with estimated ratios of carbon to nitrogen)

Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as a ""Site for Composting Facility"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Site for Composting Facility"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Site for composting facility is the site location for placement of a composting facility without the use of a liner or placement on concrete pad. The composting facility is to process raw manure or other raw organic by-products into biologically stable organic material as outlined in the NRCS conservation practice standard ""Composting Facility"" (code 317). 

Scope: National

The bottom elevation of the composting facility shall be above the seasonal high water table and on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the ground water. Compost facilities should be located outside of floodplains.  However, if site restrictions require location within a floodplain, they shall be protected from inundation or damage from a 25-year flood event, or larger. Locate compost facilities so prevailing winds and landscape elements such as building arrangement, landforms and vegetation minimize odors and protect the visual resource. Direct any contaminated runoff from compost facilities to an appropriate storage or treatment facility for further management.

Suitability of a soil for use as a site for composting should be on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the ground water. Slope affects the ease of accessing and manipulating the compost material.  It also will affect runoff from the site. If slope is limiting, then consult the ""Site for Composting Facility  Subsurface"" interpretation.


Soil interpretations for locating a site for composting are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.


Criteria used:


1.  Depth to saturated zone: Shallow depth to water table limits the site for use as a composting facility.  Soils that are shallow to water are also difficult to reclaim and revegetate, and contamination from leaching may create health and environmental hazards.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month.

	Property used: HIGH WATER TABLE DEPTH MINIMUM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 100 cm
		Somewhat limiting	=> 100 to =< 200 cm
		Not limiting		 > 200 cm
		
	Null depth to saturation is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
2.  Flooding:  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional flooding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value greater than 0 and flooding is a limiting feature:

Flooding Frequency	Months
------------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2


3.  Fragments in soil:  Large stone impede the workability of the soil and restrict trafficability of heavy machinery and site reclamation.  Soil feature considered is percent by weight rock fragments > 10 inches in size in the surface soil layer.



	Property evaluated: WTD_AVG FRAGS > 250mm 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION (Modality - high, low, and representative value)

		Somewhat suited 	=> 3 to 15 percent
		Well suited		 < 3 percent
		
	Null surface fragment coverage is assigned to the Well suited class.



5.  Seepage:  The soil horizon with the maximum Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids into and through the soil is unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become an environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the layer with the maximum Ksat within a depth of 200cm.

            Property used: KSAT HIGHEST MINIMUM, 0-200CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (Modality - high, low, representative value)

            Restriction limits:

                    Not limiting           	 =< 14.1 micrometers/sec

            Null Ksat values are assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.


6.  Depth to permafrost: Permafrost (permanently frozen soil layer) restricts or effects excavation, manipulation, transport, stability, and workability of the soil material.  Soil features considered are restrictive feature depth and where kind is permafrost or USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) is ""cpf"" or USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER is ""pf"".
	
	Property used: DEPTH TO PERMAFROST (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

OR
		
	Property used: USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	= ""pf""
		Not limiting	not = ""pf""
		
	Null USDA Texture Modifier are assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
7.  Ponding:  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional ponding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value greater than 0 and ponding is a limiting feature:

Ponding Frequency	Months
-----------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2



8.  Mean annual precipitation: Localities that have low rainfall are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low rainfall, moisture will need to be added to maintain biological activity in the composting mass.  The site feature considered is mean annual precipitation.

	Property used: PRECIPITATION (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 400 mm
		Somewhat limiting	=> 400-1200 mm
		Not limiting		 > 1200 mm
		
	Null precipitation is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.
	
	
	
9.  Slope:  The slope of the soil surface influences its trafficability for equipment and also can cause erosion hazard if steep.

	Property evaluated: SLOPE (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Poorly suited		> 8 percent  
		Somewhat suited 	<= 8 to 3 percent
		Well suited		< 3 percent
		
	Null slopes are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	
	
10.  Low strength: Soils with high AASHTO Group Index have low strength which affects the soil's traffic-supporting capacity.  This condition is only partially restrictive when clay mineralogy is kaolinitic.  Soil feature considered is the AASHTO Group Index of the
thickest soil layer between 25 and 100cm or above a cemented restrictive layer and taxonomic family mineralogy.

        Property used: AASHTO GROUP INDEX NUMBER THICKEST LAYER IN DEPTH 10-40 in. (Modality - high, low, representative value)

        Null AASHTO Group Index values are assigned to the ""Not rated"".
        
        
        
11.  Mean annual air temperature: Localities that have very low or very high mean annual air temperature are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low mean annual air temperature, the onset of decomposition may be delayed by low biological activity in the composting mass.  The additional expense of covering or insulating the composting mass may be incurred.  In very warm areas, adding extra water and more frequent turning of the mass adds to the cost of composting.  The site feature considered is mean annual air temperature.

	Property used: MEAN ANNUAL AIR TEMPERATURE (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

	Null mean annual air temperature is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.

12.  Piping: Fine textured soils high in sodium and gypsum content with low cohesion and liquid limits are subject to piping and are limited for use in building embankments, dikes, and levees.   The interpretive model uses the maximum sodium or gypsum rating index and adds the low cohesion index.  This sum is compared to the liquid limit index and the lowest index is applied to the parent rule.

Many common materials such as leaves and lumber are high in carbon and require balanced inputs of materials that are high in nitrogen such as coffee grounds or manures and urines.  Often the materials high in nitrogen are less available or more difficult to transport to the composting site. Materials intended for composting may vary in their carbon to nitrogen ratio due to many factors and testing of materials is recommended before large scale operations begin. A few C:N examples are given in table 1.

Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as a subsurface ""Site for Composting Facility"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (about 79 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Site for Composting Facility - Subsurface"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Site for subsurface composting facility is the site location for placement of a subsurface composting facility without the use of a liner or placement on concrete pad. The composting facility is to process raw manure or other raw organic by-products into biologically stable organic material as outlined in the NRCS conservation practice standard ""Composting Facility"" (code 317). 

Scope: National

The bottom elevation of the composting facility shall be above the seasonal high water table and on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the ground water. Compost facilities should be located outside of floodplains.  However, if site restrictions require location within a floodplain, they shall be protected from inundation or damage from a 25-year flood event, or larger. Locate compost facilities so prevailing winds and landscape elements such as building arrangement, landforms and vegetation minimize odors and protect the visual resource. 

Suitability of a soil for use as a site for composting should be on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the ground water. On sloping soils, cut perpendicular to the contour to obtain level surface for composting facility. Direct any contaminated runoff from compost facilities to an appropriate storage or treatment facility for further management.

Soil interpretations for locating a site for composting are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.





Criteria used:

1.  Adsorption:  Soils having a low cec or ecec may not attenuate biohazardous material from the decay process.  It is assumed that the upper 25 cm of the site will be stockpiled for use in revegetating the site.  It is also assumed that alternating layers of soil and biological materials will be placed in the excavation.

Soils having low CEC or ECEC are not able to retain some leachates.  A soil is a full member of the set of soils having low adsorption if the CEC or ECEC to clay ratio is below 0.05, a partial member between 0.05 and 0.15, and a nonmember if the cec or ecec to clay ratio is over 0.150.
	
	Property used: CLAY ACTIVITY IN DEPTH 30-200cm (Modality - low, high, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		Below 0.05 meq/100g
		Somewhat limiting	0.05-0.15 meq/100g
		Not limiting		> 0.15 meq/100g
		
	The fuzzy number is weighted by 0.25, meaning this rule cannot cause the component to be absolutely true that the site is limited for the intended land use.

			
Null clay activity is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

	
2.  Porous bedrock: Limestone bedrock (and other types) may have numerous solution channels that allow contaminants to enter the groundwater quickly and with no renovation.  The porous nature of the bedrock is often reflected by ""karst"" phases of map units.  Deeper soils will tend to lessen the risk of contamination.

		  Evaluation used: BEDROCK IS LIMESTONE

		  
		  Property used: LIMESTONE RESIDUUM TEST, NULL SENDS NO
		  
		  Restrictive Limits:
		    Limiting		If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
		    Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    
		    
		  NOTE!!!  As the property is now written, if bedrock is not populated, a N0 is returned.
		  NOTE!!!  This base rule will be expanded to evaluate more types of bedrock.
		  
		  
		  Evaluation used: Parent Material Origin is Soluble Salt
		  
		  Property used: ""PARENT MATERIAL ORIGIN IS SOLUBLE SALT""  (Modality - and representative value)
	
			Limiting	If the bedrock is soluble salt, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
		    	Not limiting	If the bedrock is not soluble salt, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    	
3.  Depth to thick/thin cemented pan: Depth to thick or thin cemented pan may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when potentially hazardous materials are buried in the soil.   Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer more then 46cm thick where restrictive kind is ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"" and restrictive feature hardness is not noncemented. If pan thickness is < 46cm then the rating is reduced by half.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	
	Property used: DEPTH TO CEMENTED PAN THICK (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 > 182cm
		Not limiting		=< 182cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	OR

	Property used: DEPTH TO CEMENTED PAN THIN (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 > 182cm
		Not limiting		=< 182cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
		
AND NOT
	
	Property used: RESTRICTIVE FEATURE HARDNESS (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		not = noncemented
		Not limiting		    = noncemented
				
	Null hardness is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
		  
		  
4.  Instability of excavation walls:  Under certain circumstances, the sides of an excavation may collapse.  This can be hazardous to anyone in the trench or near the edge at the time of failure.  The sloughed material may need to be removed from the trench, increasing the time needed to excavate.  The sides of the trench may need to be made to reflect the angle of repose of the material or be shored.
	
	
		A. Instability of the excavation walls can be caused by the coarseness of the soil material.
		
		Property used: FRAGMENT PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
		Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		Above 80 percent by volume
		     Somewhat limiting	60-80 percent by volume
		     Not limiting	Less than 60 percent by volume
		     
		 Property used: SAND PERCENT LESS CLAY IN DEPTH 30-180CM
		 
		 Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		Above 185
		     Somewhat limiting	170-185
		     Not limiting	Less than 170
		     
		  (The clay content is subtracted from the sand content.  100 is added to the difference to keep the numbers positive.  This number is a sort of effective sand content, adjusting for the adhesiveness of clay.)
		     
		     
		 B.  High shrink-swell can cause instability of excavation walls.
		 
		 Property used: LEP 25-200cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER WTD_AVE
		 
		 Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		LEP above 9
		     Somwewhat limiting	LEP 6 to 9
		     Not limiting	LEP less than 6
		     
		     
		  C. Silty material that is not loess can be unstable.
		  
		  Property used: PARENT MATERIAL KIND IS LOESS
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		High silt and not loess
		     Not limiting	High silt and is loess
		     
		  Property used: SILT PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		     Somewhat limiting	Greater than 75 percent silt
		     Not limiting	Less than 75 percent silt
		     
		  Silt content is not considered to ever be a severe limitation.
		  
		  
		   D. Gypsiferous soils can be non-cohesive if they are not cemented.  The amount of gypsum is related to the instability hazard, as is the depth to the cememnted layer, if one exists.  This subrule examines the gypsum content and the depth to a cemented layer.  A cemented gypsiferous soil is not considered to be a cave in hazard.

			Property used:  GYPSUM 10-200cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER WTD_AVE
			Evaluation used:  Gypsum WTD_AVG from 10cm to Restriction

			Restrictive limits:	Not limiting  		<=75 cm
			Limiting		75-200 cm
			Severely limiting 	 >=200 cm
		  
		  


5.  Depth to saturated zone: Shallow depth to water table limits the site for use as a composting facility.  Soils that are shallow to water are also difficult to reclaim and revegetate, and contamination from leaching may create health and environmental hazards.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month.

	Property used: HIGH WATER TABLE DEPTH MINIMUM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 100 cm
		Somewhat limiting	=> 100 to =< 200 cm
		Not limiting		 > 200 cm
		
	Null depth to saturation is assigned to the Not limiting class.	



6.  Flooding:  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional flooding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value greater than 0 and flooding is a limiting feature:

Flooding Frequency	Months
------------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2
	



7.  Surface rock fragments:  Soils that have large fragments on the surface have reduced trafficability.  The large rock fragments on the surface must be removed.  Rock fragment coverage criteria are as follows.


	Property evaluated: FRAGMENTS >=250MM ON THE SURFACE  (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Poorly suited		 > 15 percent
		Somewhat suited 	=> 3 to 15 percent
		Well suited		 < 3 percent
		
	Null surface fragment coverage is assigned to the Well suited class.

		  

8.  Content of organic matter: Soil in Unified class pt, ol, or oh is high in organic materials, has low strength, and is hard to reclaim.  Soil feature considered is the rv or first Unified class of the thickest soil layer above a restrictive layer and between 30 and 200cm.
	
	Property used: UNIFIED THICKEST LAYER 30-200cm (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	= pt, ol, or oh
		Not limiting	not = pt, ol, or oh
		
	Null Unified classes are assigned to the Not limiting class.

		  
9.  Depth to permafrost: Permafrost (permanently frozen soil layer) restricts or effects excavation, manipulation, transport, stability, and workability of the soil material.  Soil features considered are restrictive feature depth and where kind is permafrost or USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) is ""cpf"" or USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER is ""pf"".
	
	Property used: DEPTH TO PERMAFROST (Modality - representative value)

	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	= ""cpf""
		Not limiting	not = ""cpf""
		
	Null USDA Texture (In-Lieu-Of) are assigned to the Not limiting class.
OR
		
	Property used: USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	= ""pf""
		Not limiting	not = ""pf""
		
	Null USDA Texture Modifier are assigned to the Not limiting class.
	


10.  Ponding:  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional ponding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value greater than 0 and ponding is a limiting feature:

Ponding Frequency	Months
-----------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2


11.  Precipitation:  Mean annual precipitation: Localities that have low rainfall are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low rainfall, moisture will need to be added to maintain biological activity in the composting mass.  The site feature considered is mean annual precipitation.

	Property used: PRECIPITATION (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		
		Somewhat limiting    	= 0-1200 mm
		Not limiting		 > 1200 mm
	
                The fuzzy number for this rule is limited with a 0.25 multiplier hedge to never be more than somewhat limiting.
	Null precipitation is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.
	
	
	
12.  Large stone impede the workability of the soil and restrict trafficability of heavy machinery and site reclamation. Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in the horizons above a restrictive feature or from 0 to 200 cm deep.

            Property used: FRAGMENTS > 75mm Wt. Ave. 0-200cm (Modality - high, low, representative value)

            Restrictive limits:
                    Limiting                	=> 50%
                    Somewhat limiting        	> 25% to < 50%
                    Not limiting            	=< 25%

            Null fragment data are assigned Not rated. 	
	


	
13.  Rock Outcrop:  Areas that have rock outcrop in the vicinity are not likely to have a sufficiently large area of soil for the facility.  Rock outcrops can interfere with renovation of the leachate from the facility.
        
        Property used: PA ROCK OUTCROP 2(Modality - representative value)
        
        Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		The phase ""rock outcrop"" occurs in the map unit name.
		Not limiting		The phase ""rock outcrop"" does not occur in the map unit name.
		
		
Any soil with a portion or full map unit name of Rock Outcrop is returned as a value of 1 and is given the rating of Rock Outcrop and is considered a limitation.

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""rocky"" is returned as a value of .3 and is given the rating of ""Slight Rock Outcrop"".

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""very rocky"" is returned as a value of .7 and is given the rating of ""Severe Rock Outcrop"".

All map units have a name, no null data should be encountered.



14.  Seepage:  The soil's bottom layer Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids through the soil and underlying materials is unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the Ksat of the bottom layer or the layer immediately above bedrock.  This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes.  
	
	Property used: KSAT BOTTOM HORIZON (Modality - high, low, representative value)
			
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting 	 	 => 14.0 micrometers/sec
		Not limiting		  < 14.0 micrometers/sec
		
	Null Ksat values are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
6/15/04 PRF modified the hedge from ""NULL NOT RATED"" to ""NOT NULL AND"".  The Null values were throwing out a ""Not Rated"" that affected the final rating.



15.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's adsorptive capacity and the thickness of the biologically active zone through with waste materials can percolate.  Shallow soils may pose environmental and health risks when agricultural and municipal waste materials are applied. These soils may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when trench landfills are installed. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"" or ""bedrock (paralithic)."" Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

	Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 200cm
		Not limiting		=> 200cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
16.  Slope: Steep slopes impede trafficability of heavy machinery and reclamation of borrow sites.  Soil feature considered is the component slope.
		
	Property used: SLOPE (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		> 15%
		Somewhat limiting	>= 8 and <= 15%
		Not limiting		< 8%			
		
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.
	
	
	
	
17.  Mean annual air temperature: Localities that have very low or very high mean annual air temperature are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low mean annual air temperature, the onset of decomposition may be delayed by low biological activity in the composting mass.  The additional expense of covering or insulating the composting mass may be incurred.  In very warm areas, adding extra water and more frequent turning of the mass adds to the cost of composting.  The site feature considered is mean annual air temperature.

	Property used: MEAN ANNUAL AIR TEMPERATURE (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 <= 8 and >30 degrees C 
		Somewhat limiting	 8 to <=10 and 22 to <=30 degrees C
		Not limiting		 >10 to <=22 degrees C
		
	Null mean annual air temperature is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.	
	
	
18.  Water Gathering Surface: Some surfaces are shaped so as to gather water.  This additional water may cause problems for land use.  Soils that are concave up and down their slope and concave across their slope are most strongly water gathering.  Soils that are concave across their slope and linear or convex up and down their slopes are less water collecting.  Soils that are linear across their slopes and concave up and down their slopes are somewhat water collecting.  Soils that are convex up and down their slopes and convex across their slopes are the least water gathering.

Water gathering (concave) surfaces can concentrate water flow and cause accelerated erosion.  Increased costs because of materials and land shaping may be needed to prevent erosion.
		  
		  Property Used: WATER GATHERING SURFACE
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		    Somewhat Limiting		Concave up-down, concave across surfaces
		    Slightly limiting		Concave across, linear or convex up-down
		    Not limiting		All other surface shapes
		    
		  NOTE!!!  The fuzzy number returned by this rule can not exceed 0.5.
		  
Null slope shape is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

19. Piping: Fine textured soils high in sodium and gypsum content with low cohesion and liquid limits are subject to piping and are limited for use in building embankments, dikes, and levees.   The interpretive model uses the maximum sodium or gypsum rating index and adds the low cohesion index.  This sum is compared to the liquid limit index and the lowest index is applied to the parent rule.

	{Soil feature considered is the maximum percent gypsum found in the soil layers.
	
	Property used: GYPSUM MAXIMUM (Modality - high, low, representative value)
			
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting 	 	=> 25%

"TX201"|"FOR - Potential Fire Damage Hazard"|"limitation"|"FOR - POTENTIAL FIRE DAMAGE HAZARD
-------------------------------

Refer to section 537 of the National Forestry Manual for specific soil rating criteria.

Description:

The potential hazard of damage to soil nutrient, physical, and biotic characteristics from fire. 

Ratings assess:

* The impact of fires (prescribed or wildfire) of moderate fireline intensity (116-520 btu's/sec/ft) that provide the necessary heat to remove the duff layer and consume soil organic matter in the surface layer. 

Ratings assume:

* Soils with a shallow surface layer lack the capacity to safely absorb the effects of fire.
 
* Steep slopes are more likely to erode if the protective duff layer is removed.

* Soil texture and rock fragment content relate to soil erodibility, vegetative recovery rate, and vegetative productivity.
 
* Medium textured soils, with their greater inherent water holding capacity, aaare more likely to be cooler and provide higher productivty potential
 
*Soils with large volumes of rock fragments transmit heat to a greater depth in a shorter period of time.
 
* Soils with less than 2 percent organic matter are more resistant to sheet and rill erosion and have greater water holding capacity.
 
Ratings do not assess:

* The time of year in which the fire occurs (winter versus summer).
 
* Fuel moisture content or volume.
 
* Whether conditions
 
Rating Classes (Crisp):

*None - No impact to the soil characteristis are expected. 

* Low - Little negative impact to the soil characteristics are expected.

* Moderate - Negative impacts to the soil characteristic may occur.

* High - Negative impact to the soil characteristics are expected."|07/19/2018 19:46:25|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666490"
"TX201"|"AGR - Filter Strips (TX)"|"limitation"|"Filter Strips

Summary:  A filter strip is an area of grass or other permanent vegetation used to reduce sediment, organics, nutrients, pesticides, and other contaminants from runoff and to maintain or improve water quality.

Filter strips intercept undesirable contaminates from runoff before they enter a waterbody.  They provide a buffer between contaminant sources, such as crop fields, and waterbodies, such as streams and ponds.  Filter strips slow the velocity of water, allowing the settling out of suspended soil particles, infiltration of runoff and soluble pollutants, adsorption of pollutants on soil and plant surfaces, and uptake of soluble pollutants by plants.

Filter strips are normally established as part of a conservation management system to address the soil, water, air, plant, and animal needs and the owners objectives.  It is important to plan the conservation crop rotation, nutrient and pest management, crop residue management, and other cropland practices.  Filter strips can also provide forage production and improve farm aesthetics.  They are most effective when used in combination with other agronomic or structural practices to provide conservation benefits.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 100 cm (40 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope: Properties that influence the risk of vegetative growth, runoff, site, and subsoil filtering capacity are major considerations.  Soils that flood, pond, or have a water table within the rooting zone have a potential pollution hazard and vegetative cover is difficult to establish.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the velocity of runoff onto and through the filter strip.

Description: Filter Strip interpretations are divided into 4 components.  These are vegetative establishment, runoff vulnerability, site features, and subsoil filtering-capacity.  Vegetative establishment is characterized by surface texture, rooting depth, water table, flooding during the growing season, ponding, pH, slope salinity, and ponding.  Runoff is characterized by slope and surface permeability.  Site features are characterized by slope, flooding, and ponding.  Finally, subsoil-filtering capacity is characterized by the subsoils adsorptive capacity, depth to water table, bedrock or cemented pan, and high permeability seepage.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.  Criteria are based on NRCS Practice Standard  Filter Strip, Code 393, Texas, 4/2001.

A.  VEGETATIVE COVER

Soils vary in their capacity to support various filter strip cover establishment and growth.  The use and management of soils for filter strips is directly dependent on individual soil properties and characteristics.  The interpretive ratings are designed to provide the user with information about presence of soil's properties or characteristic that may limit their use and management for filter strips.  The interpretive rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, and water sources.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Too clayey: Clayey surface layers are slippery and sticky when wet, are slow to dry, and, when dry, are usually hard.  Timing and techniques that are used in preparing a seedbed, planting, and mechanical manipulation will improve vegetative establishment and growth.  Hard surfaces affect seedling emergence and survival.

	Property used: ""CLAY PERCENT SURFACE LAYER (TX)"" (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Somewhat limiting	>= 60%
		Not limiting		 > 60%
			
	Null clay percentage is assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	2.  Depth to restriction: A restrictive layer adversely affects potential rooting depth and regrowth.  The layers are either too hard or too dense for root penetration.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

	Property used: ""DEPTH TO FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE (TX)"" (Modality - high, low, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=< 25cm
		Somewhat limiting	 > 25 and < 100cm
		Not limiting		=> 100cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	3.  Depth to saturated zone: Soils with shallow depth to a water table maybe difficult to work and have a restricted rooting zone.  These areas are slow to drain and can become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during the growing season.

	Property used: ""DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE, Growing Season (TX)"" (Modality - high, low, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

C.	SITE FEATURES

The Filter Strip Site Features (TX) sub-rule describes site characteristics that limits the site's potential use for Filter Strips.

The site characteristics considered by this interpretive rule are flooding; ponding; or slope.  Each of these site characteristics is assigned an index value between 1 and 0.  Sites having values of 1 have the highest limitations effecting the use of this soil for filiter fields.  Soils with values of 0 are not limited by site characteristics.  Index values between 0 and 1 are somewhat limited and that limitation is reflected in the magnitude of the site index number.

Criteria:

	1.  Flooding: Flooding: Stream overflow, runoff, or high tides flooding adversely affects the use and management of these areas.  Flooding poses a significant hazard for surface water pollution and will delay use of the area until the floodwater has receded and the soils have dried sufficiently to allow renewed activity.

	Property used: ""FLOODING FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest (TX)"" (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

		Not limiting		=< 2%			
		
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.

D.	SUBSOIL FILTERING CAPACITY

The Subsurface Filter Field (TX) sub-rule describes site characteristics that affect the storage and movement of leachate through the soil.

The filter field characteristics considered by this interpretive rule are depth to bedrock, cemented pan, or water table; soil adsorption capacity; and seepage.  Each of these site characteristics is assigned an index value between 1 and 0.  Sites having values of 1 have the highest limitations effecting the storage leachates that have entered the soil.  Sites with values of 0 are not limited by site characteristics.  Index values between 0 and 1 are somewhat limited and that limitation is reflected in the magnitude of the site index number.

The Subsurface Filter Field (TX) sub-rule design selects the most restrictive site characteristic and that index value is passed to filter strip index.

Criteria:

	1.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's water holding capacity and the thickness of the root zone.  Deeper soils have more ability to store water, air and nutrients. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock*"".  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

	Property used: ""DEPTH TO BEDROCK (TX)"" (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 50cm
		Not limiting		=> 50cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	2.  Depth to cemented pan: Shallow depth to cemented pan limits the soil's water holding capacity and the thickness of the root zone.  Deeper soils have more ability to store water, air and nutrients.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

	Property used: ""DEPTH TO FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE (TX)"" (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 50cm
		Not limiting		>= 50cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

	     	Not limiting	 not = ""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or ""petrogypsic"" 
		
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

	Property used: ""FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE HARDNESS (TX)"" (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		not = ""Noncemented""
	     	Not limiting		    = ""Noncemented""
		
	Null hardness is assigned to the limiting class.
	
	3.  Depth to saturated zone: Soils with shallow depth to a water table maybe difficult to work and have a restricted rooting zone.  These areas are slow to drain and can become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month.

	Property used: ""DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM (TX)"" (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=< 60cm
		Somewhat limiting	 > 60 to < 120cm
		Not limiting		=> 120cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	4.  Adsorptive Capacity is the capacity of the soil to adsorb and attenuate heavy metals, salts, and other detrimental manure mineralization by-products.  The mineralized manure by-products are held by the soils adsorptive capacity as represented by the soils CEC and by its absorption capacity as represented by the soils available water capacity.

Leachates from the manure stockpile are held in place and leach slowly through soils with high adsorptive capacity.  These soils have a lower risk of polluting underlying ground water then do soil with low adsorptive capacity.  Low adsorption and doughtiness define the characteristics that rate a soil as having limiting, somewhat limiting, or not limiting adsorptive capacity.  These soil characteristics are further defined as:

		a.  Low adsorption: Soils with low CEC to clay ratio have limited potential for sequestering heavy metals, organic decomposition byproducts allowing contamination of underlying aquifers.  Soil feature considered is the soil's weighted average of the cec/clay ratio (calculated from cec and clay representative values).

		Property used: ""CLAY ACTIVITY (TX)"" (Modality - representative value)
			
		Restrictive limits:
			Limiting		=< 0.050
			Somewhat limiting	 > 0.050 to  < 0.150
			Not limiting		=> 0.150
			
		Null cec or clay are assigned to the Not rated class.

	OR

		b.  Droughty: Soils with low available water capacity have limited potential for sustaining vigorous plant growth and applicaiton rates per acre should be lowered.  Soil feature considered is the (available water capacity * the layer thickness) summed through the last soil layer or to a cemented restrictive layer.

	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		=> 42.0 um/sec
		Somewhat limiting	 > 14 to < 42.0 um/sec 
		Not limiting		<= 14 um/sec
		
	Null Ksat is assigned not rated."|06/19/2009 17:31:00|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666381"

Background:

Strontium-90 and Cesium-137 are radionuclides that can be released into the atmosphere as a result of above-ground nuclear explosions and inadvertent leakage from nuclear facilities, such as powerplants.  The behavior of strontium in the soil system is close to calcium.  Both are divalent metal cations.  Strontium, having a slightly smaller hydrated radius is more tightly held by the exchange complex than calcium.  Cesium acts in a fashion similar to potassium.  Both are monovalent metal cations.  Cesium is held more tightly that potassium, due to a smaller hydrated radius.  The characteristics of the soil upon which the radionuclides fall determines whether or not and to what extent they are available to plants and subsequently to animals.

Cations such as strontium or cesium added to the surface of the soil as fallout can have one of several fates.  

1 - They can be taken up by plants and cycled in the organic matter of the soil.  This is particularly true in acidic forest soils where the pH is below 5.5.  At this level of pH, aluminum solubilizes and can become the dominant cation in many soils, essentially driving basic cations off of the exchange into solution, where either they are absorbed by plant roots or they leach from the soil system. 
2 - They can be tied to the exchange surface and rendered more or less unavailable for plant uptake.  Owing to their small concentrations and generally high affinity for adsorption by the exchange, a soil having a large supply of basic cations and plentiful exchange sites will bind the radionuclides away from absorption by plant roots owing simply to mass action.  
3 - If the soil lacks the exchange capacity or the soil reaction is unfavorable for attenuation, they can be leached below the root zone and eventually into ground water or surface waters.  
4 - If the soil contains carbonates or sulfates, strontium can be tied up in the structures of these compounds.  
5 - Cesium, which is similar in ionic radius and charge to potassium can be absorbed by 2:1 layer silicates.

The sequestration of cesium and strontium is favored by several soil conditions.  High cation exchange capacity in the upper 30cm of soil causes these ions to be absorbed rather than in soil solution.  pH above 5.5 causes the exchange complex to be largely available for basic cations, which allows cesium and strontium to be taken proportionally from soil solution.  A thin organic surface provides less of a reservoir for cesium and strontium.  A preponderance of clay minerals in the soil enhances the extent to which cesium and strontium can be attenuated by the soil.  When first deposited, particulate to which cesium and strontium are adsorbed can be moved around on the landscape by water and wind, so convex land surfaces are less susceptible to accumulation.  If calcium carbonate or gypsum are present, strontium can be tightly held in these minerals and not available for uptake. 


Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member, or complete members of the set of soils that are suspected of having a high  Potential for Radioactive Sequestration of radionuclides in soil constituents, either oragnic or mineral.  If a soil's properties within 30 cm (~12 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater than zero, then that soil property contributes to the sequestration of radioactive material.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Potential for Radioactive Sequestration"" interpretive rule.  Minor contributing soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These contributing features could be important factors where the major contributing features are overcome through management, when possible.  Studies from Europe indicate a fairly low mobility in soils, so only the upper 30cm of the profile is considered (Hrachowitz et al, 2005).

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are very low sequestration potential  (rating index = 0), some sequestration potential (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or high sequestration potential (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Potential for Radioactive Sequestration is a method of arraying soils based on their potential ability to sequester radionuclides.  This information can be displayed spatially to show the extent and location of areas where sequestration may occur in the event of a leakage of radioactive material.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Criteria used:

1.  Carbonate sequestration:  Calcium carbonate in the soil tightly holds strontium, so if a soil has appreciable carbonates, the potential for sequestration is high.


Property used: CALCIUM CARBONATE FROM 0 to 30cm


Limits:

	CCE	0	no sequestering from CaCO3
	CCE	0-10	some sequestering from CaCO3
	CCE	>10	high degree of sequestering from CaCO3
	
	Null CaCO3 is assigned 0.
	
	
	
2.  The type and amount of clay in the upper 30cm of the soil can affect the sequestration or holding of cesium and strontium.  The pH of the soil affects the suite of cations available in soil solution.  At higher pH, the exchange is dominated by basic cations, which plants take up and use.  In lower pH systems, the exchange is dominated by hydrogen and aluminum, which plants do not absorb.  Thus, the beneficial, in terms of sequestration, effects of the clay content are negated as pH is decreased.  This subrule models the change in sequestration from a higher pH system to a lower pH.

Subrules used:

Sequestration Clay Content, Raw
Bioaccumulation pH

The fuzzy numbers from these subrules are used in the calculation.

Calculation:  Sequestration Clay Content = (Sequestration Clay Content, Raw)-(Bioaccumulation pH)


	A.  The clay content of the upper 30cm of the soil determines in part how available to plants various ions added by eolean additions may be.  In a soil having a large amount of clay, the ability of the soil to tie up ions in the lattice, especially cesium in 2:1 clays, can decrease the plant availability of the added cations from fallout. 


Property used:  WTD_AVG CLAY CONTENT 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION

Limits:


	clay content	0 percent	low potential for sequestration
	clay content	>0-18 percent	moderate potential for sequestration
	clay content	>18 percent	high potential for sequestration.
	
	Null clay content is assigned ""Not Rated"".
	
	
	B.  The pH of the upper 30cm of the soil determines in part the concentrations of various ions in soil solution.  In soils having a high pH, the ions added by eolean additions will comprise a smaller portion of the cations available for plant uptake.  It is assumed that in soils having a higher pH, the base saturation will be higher and so the cesium and strontium will represent a smaller proportion of the available cations in soil solution.  It is also assumed plants will not preferentially adsorb the radioactive constituents.  If the pH is low, the cations from fallout will be taken  up by plants and cycled.    

Property used:  WTD_AVG PH 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION 

Limits:


	pH 	<5.0	low potential for sequestration   
	pH 	5.0-7.0	moderate potential for sequestration   
	pH 	>7.0	high potential for sequestration.
	
	Null pH is assigned ""Not Rated"".
	
	
3.  Calcium sulfate in the soil tightly holds strontium, so if a soil has appreciable gypsum, the potential for sequestration is high.


Property used: GYPSUM FROM 0 to 30cm


Limits:

	gypsum content	0 percent	no sequestering from gypsum 
	gypsum content	0-10 percent	some sequestering from gypsum
	gypsum content	>10 percent	high degree of sequestering from gypsum
	
	Null gypsum content is assigned 0.
	
	
	
4.  Organic surface sequestration:  In a forested environment, particularly on acid, sandy soils, the surface organic horizon comprises the reservoir of available plant nutrients.  Nutrients are cycled, stored, and recycled through the organic mat.  As the subsurface soil becomes more fertile (contains more nutrients) the impact of the organic surface horizon is lessened and the added strontium and cesium can be effectively sequestered.  Soils having both high CEC and high pH are assumed to be fertile and more prone to sequester while soils that have low CEC and low pH are prone to have Sr and Cs more bioavailable.

Properties used:

MEQ 0-30cm OR RESTRICTION

Limits:

	milliequivalents of exchange 	0	no sequestering from exchange  
	milliequivalents of exchange 	0-10	some sequestering from exchange

	Null CEC is assignrd ""Not Rated"".



WTD_AVG PH 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION

Limits:

	pH 	<5.5	no sequestering   
	pH 	5.5-6.5	some sequestering   
	pH 	>6.5	high degree of sequestering.
	
	Null pH is assigned ""Not Rated"".



THICKNESS OF SURFACE ORGANIC HORIZON

Limits:
	0 cm		No bioaccumulation in organic layer
	>0-20 cm	moderate potential of accumulation in organic layer
	>20 cm		high potential for accumulation in the organic layer.
	
	Null organic horizon thickness is assigned 0.
	
	
Evaluations used:

MEQ 0-10 in depth 0-30cm
pH 5.5-6.5 in depth 0-30cm
Organic Horizon Thickness.

The fuzzy numbers from these evaluations are used in the calculation.

Calculation:

Sequestration Organic Surface =[(MEQ 0-10 in depth 0-30cm/2)+(pH 5.5-6.5 in depth 0-30cm/2)] - Organic Horizon Thickness



5.  Convex areas on the landscape tend to spread or lose water and material and send it to adjacent areas.  Strontium and cesium are added to the soil surface as fallout and are thus susceptible to redistribution by erosion, especially when newly deposited on a surface lacking an organic layer.  The general consensus is that very little erosion occurs on soils having an O horizon.  Some soils are more erodible than others, due to their composition, as is related by the K factor.  Slope is a contributor to erosion.

Property used:  EROSION FACTOR SURFACE LAYER, ORGANIC 0.02

"TX201"|"DHS - Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (~79 inches) of the soil surface has a membership index greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership index for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit is a method of disposing dead animals by placing the carcasses in successive layers in an excavated pit having sloped sidewalls.  The intent is that this interpretation will be used to site facilities for disposal of diseased animals where the pathogen needs to be contained.  The carcasses are spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the pit.  When the pit is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the burial pit.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

The estimated land area needed to dispose of mature cattle ranges from 1.2 (McDaniel, 1991) to 3.5 (Ollis, 2002) cubic yards.  A single adult bovine is considered equivalent to 5 sheep or 5 hogs (McDaniel, 1991; USDA, 1980).  Lund et al estimate that about 92,000 cubic yards of volume would be needed to dispose of 30,000 head of cattle, assuming a trench depth of 8.5 feet (which is somewhat below the depth of observation for typical soil survey).  This is about seven acres.  Leachate collection should be considered because the putrefaction of one adult bovine is estimated to release 21 gallons of fluid in the first week and a total of about 42 gallons in the first month (Munroe, 2001).  Collection of gases released during the decomposition process should also be considered. 

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  However, because pits may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the pit developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the pit.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing pits for which the pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a Large Animal Disposal, Pit operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled pit area.

	Null EC is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
15.  Seepage:  The soil's bottom layer Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids through the soil and underlying materials is unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become environmental, health, and performance concern.

6/15/04 PRF modified the hedge from ""NULL NOT RATED"" to ""NOT NULL AND"".  The Null values were throwing out a ""Not Rated"" that affected the final rating.



16.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's adsorptive capacity and the thickness of the biologically active zone through with waste materials can percolate.  Shallow soils may pose environmental and health risks when agricultural and municipal waste materials are applied. These soils may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when trench landfills are installed. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"" or ""bedrock (paralithic)."" Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

19.  Water Gathering Surface: Some surfaces are shaped so as to gather water.  This additional water may cause problems for land use.  Soils that are concave up and down their slope and concave across their slope are most strongly water gathering.  Soils that are concave across their slope and linear or convex up and down their slopes are less water collecting.  Soils that are linear across their slopes and concave up and down their slopes are somewhat water collecting.  Soils that are convex up and down their slopes and convex across their slopes are the least water gathering.

Water gathering (concave) surfaces can concentrate water flow and cause accelerated erosion.  Increased costs because of materials and land shaping may be needed to prevent erosion.
		  
		  Property Used: WATER GATHERING SURFACE
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		    Somewhat Limiting		Concave up-down, concave across surfaces
		    Slightly limiting		Concave across, linear or convex up-down
		    Not limiting		All other surface shapes
		    
		  NOTE!!!  The fuzzy number returned by this rule can not exceed 0.5.
		  
Null slope shape is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.



20.  Too acid: Soils with low pH increase metallic ion availability and restricts plant growth and re-establishing vegetation in disturbed area.  Soil feature considered is the minimum (pH) of the soil layers.

"TX201"|"DHS - Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Trench"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Trench"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (~79 inches) of the soil surface has a membership index greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership index for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Trench"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Trench is a method of disposing dead animals by placing the carcasses in successive layers in an excavated trench having sloped sidewalls.  The intent is that this interpretation will be used to site facilities for disposal of diseased animals where the pathogen needs to be contained.  The carcasses are spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the trench.  When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the filled trench area.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

The estimated land area needed to dispose of mature cattle ranges from 1.2 (McDaniel, 1991) to 3.5 (Ollis, 2002) cubic yards.  A single adult bovine is considered equivalent to 5 sheep or 5 hogs (McDaniel, 1991; USDA, 1980).  Lund et al estimate that about 92,000 cubic yards of volume would be needed to dispose of 30,000 head of cattle, assuming a trench depth of 8.5 feet (which is somewhat below the depth of observation for typical soil survey).  This is about seven acres.  Leachate collection should be considered because the putrefaction of one adult bovine is estimated to release 21 gallons of fluid in the first week and a total of about 42 gallons in the first month (Munroe, 2001).  Collection of gases released during the decomposition process should also be considered.  To bury adult hogs or sheep, a rule of thumb is to multiply the capacities listed above by five. For broiler chickens (market-ready weight), multiply the capacity by 200. For turkeys (market-ready weight) multiply the capacity by 40 (Ollis, 2002).  

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  However, because trenches may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the trench developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed trench bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the trench.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the trench is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a Large Animal Disposal, Trench operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled area.

4.  Too clayey:  This rule evaluates textures from the thickest layers between 30 and 200 cm.  Textures of cl, sicl, sc, sic, and c are rated as too clayey.  If clay minerology is kaolinitic or the soil is in an aridic moisture regime the clay content is not a restrictive feature.  Clayey soils may become sticky when wet and are difficult to spread and compact.  This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes and is only partially restrictive when clay mineralogy is kaolinitic. Soil feature considered is the weighted average of clay content between 30 and 200cm or above a restrictive layer and taxonomic family mineralogy.

16.  Seepage:  The soil's bottom layer Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids through the soil and underlying materials is unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the Ksat of the bottom layer or the layer immediately above bedrock.

20.  Water Gathering Surface: Some surfaces are shaped so as to gather water.  This additional water may cause problems for land use.  Soils that are concave up and down their slope and concave across their slope are most strongly water gathering.  Soils that are concave across their slope and linear or convex up and down their slopes are less water collecting.  Soils that are linear across their slopes and concave up and down their slopes are somewhat water collecting.  Soils that are convex up and down their slopes and convex across their slopes are the least water gathering.

Water gathering (concave) surfaces can concentrate water flow and cause accelerated erosion.  Increased costs because of materials and land shaping may be needed to prevent erosion.

		  Restrictive limits:
		    Somewhat Limiting		Concave up-down, concave across surfaces
		    Slightly limiting		Concave across, linear or convex up-down
		    Not limiting		All other surface shapes
		    
		  NOTE!!!  The fuzzy number returned by this rule can not exceed 0.5.
		  
Null slope shape is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.



21.  Too acid: Soils with low pH increase metallic ion availability and restricts plant growth and re-establishing vegetation in disturbed area.  Soil feature considered is the minimum (pH) of the soil layers.
	
	Property used: SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER (Minimum) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
				
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting	 < 3.5
		Not limiting	=> 3.5
			
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

22.  Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gupsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of traffic on the road.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

Summary:  Soil ""Water Erosion Potential (TX)"" evaluates a soil's potential to erode through the action of water.  The potential assumes that the area being affected is bare, smooth, and exposed to the water erosion processes.
 
Scope:  The soil's water erosion potential is based on those intrinsic soil attributes or combination of attributes and landscape runoff characteristics that have a low resistance to erosion processes.  Those soil attributes that contribute to water erosivity are particle size, permeability, and high runoff landscapes.  Conversely, soil attributes that resist the erosive affect of water are high organic matter content and low runoff landscapes.  The soil water erosion potential is the interaction of those soil features that make the soil susceptible to water erosion and those that resist the water erosion process.

The potential degree of water erodibility is expressed as a numeric index between 1.0 (Highest potential for erosion) and 0.0 (lowest potential erosion).  The potential degree to which a soil is susceptible to water erosion will range from ""High"" to ""Low"" (numerically 1.0 to 0.0).  Soils that have favorable particle size, high organic matter content, or low runoff have ""Low"" water erosion potential.  Soils that have ""High"" water erosion potential are those with soil attributes in combination with high runoff having low resistance to water erosion processes.

CRITERIA: Criteria are adapted from AgHandbook 703, Chapter 3, July 1996.

The soils water erosion potential is an interaction between the surface soil's content of silt + very fine sand, permeability, organic matter content, and the soil's runoff potential.  The soil's water erosion potential is expressed as a function of the degree of limitation expressed by the interpretive rules as illustrated in following equation.

Soil Water Erosion Potential = ""runoff potential"" * (the Organic Matter numeric rating *(Silt numeric rating + .2 * (the Ksat numeric rating))).

Logic:  The model first determines the runoff potential and then multiples that value by the soil's intrinsic water erosivity potential."|03/11/2009 19:17:49|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666385"

Summary:  Air Quality; PM10 Potential (TX) interpretive model evaluates a soil's potential as a source of PM10 airborne particulates.  The potential assumes that the area being affected is dry, bare, smooth, and has a long distance that is exposed to the wind.

OVERVIEW:  Air quality is a function of PM10 and smaller particles that are held in airborne suspension.  Sources of these particles are smoke, exhaust and industrial emission, dust from roads and agricultural activities.  This suite of soil interpretations address the potential of soils used for the production of food and fiber to contribute to airborne PM10 concentrations.

CONCEPTS:  There are intrinsic properties of the soil and climate that facilitate the transport of airborne dust and particles less then or equal to 10 micrometers (PM10).  For agricultural lands, those used for the production of food, fiber, and/or grazing lands, these intrinsic properties are:
	
	1.	Climate
		a.	Wind Velocity which creates saltation impact velocities => .3 m sec-1.  Data source wind rose from WCC.  Could be linked to MLRA units?
		b.	Moisture regime that include aridic, torric, ustic, and xeric.
		c.	Other to be defined during field testing and evaluation.
	
	2.	Soil
		a.	Surface particle size (source)
		b.	Surface carbonates (source and process catalyst)
		c.	Surface salt (source and process catalyst)
		d.	Surface Organic Matter content (impedes the process)
		e.	Surface coarse fragments (impedes the process)
		f.	Other to be defined during field testing and evaluation.

The relationship of these intrinsic properties to the soils potential for providing a source of PM10 particulates has been tentatively established by various researchers.  The interpretation in the Air Quality Soil Interpretive Suite is an initial effort to adapt the research results to a soil interpretive model which derives its inputs for the areas of concerns SSURGO data.  

These interpretive models are NOT DESIGNED to quantify PM10 airborne particles from agricultural lands but to identify those areas that have potential to emit PM10 particles and to describe that potential on a scale of 0 (no potential) to 1.00 (highest potential).  It must be understood that a soil with the highest potential to emit PM10 particles may not be a contributing source if vegetated, wet, or protected when wind velocity exceed those that initiate saltation and transport of PM10 particles.  But, it still has an inherent potential to emit PM10 particles.

INTERPRETIVE MODEL OUTLINE AND SPECIFICATION:
	
	1.	Assumption and Conditions:
		a.	The soil surface is bare  (Conventional till or No-till) should interpretations be based on practice?  No-till not a source, conventional till is a source.  Should credit be given to No-till of reducing PM10 and PM2.5 emissions
		b.	The soil surface is dry
		c.	The soil surface is smooth
		d.	Soil is dry
		e.	Wind velocities exceed those needed to begin saltation and generate a saltation impact velocity of .3 m sec-1: Hagen; 1995
		f.	Interpretations are applicable to mineral soils only.
		g.	Soils with a rating of 1.0 have very high potential as a source of PM10.  These soils have a high PM10 index plus surface catalyst (salt or carbonates) and no mediating factors (high OM or coarse fragments).
		h.	Soils with a rating of 0.0 have a low potential as a source of PM 10 emissions.
		i.	PM10 particles are fine silt and clay.
	
	2.	Soil properties considered :
	a.	OM content:
		i.	0 to 2% no mediation
		ii.	2 to 6 % moderate mediation
		iii.	6% high mediation
	b.	Coarse Fragments:
		i.	0 to 15% no mediation
		ii.	15 to 35% moderate mediation less one class
		iii.	35 to 60% high mediation less two classes
		iv.	60% very high mediation (not a source)
	c.	Surface CaCO3 and surface texture not sand: Zobeck, etal; May 1999.
		i.	0 to 5% no effect
		ii.	5 to 15% moderate increase source potential
		iii.	15% high increase source potential
	
	3.	Model design:  A The PM10 index is adjusted for ancillary surface properties.  A plus adjustment (potential increase in source emissions) is made for surface CaCO3 and a minus adjustment (potential decrease in source emissions) is made for surface coarse fragments and/or organic matter content.
		i.	PM10 index (Carvacho etal, 2001) Average of sand and clay regressions where PM 10 index = 4.212 - 0.019 * sand% and PM 10 index = 2.404 + 0.031 * clay% produce a smooth index based on both soil's surface sand and clay particle size.
		
Scope: The PM10 particulate potential of the soil is attributed to those soil surface properties that by themselves or in combination with others contribute to the soil potential as a source of PM10 particulate matter.  Those soil surface attributes that contribute to the soil's PM10 potential are particle size and carbonate content.  Conversely, soil surface attributes that reduce the potential are organic matter content and coarse fragments.  The soil's PM10 potential is the interaction of those soil surface features.

The soil's potential as a PM10 source is expressed as a number between 1.0 (Highest potential for PM10 emissions) and 0.0 (lowest potential for PM10 emissions).  The potential will range from ""Very high"" to ""very low"" (numerically 1.0 to 0.0).  Soils that have favorable surface particle size, high organic matter content, or armoring coarse fragments will have (Low) PM10 emissions potential.  Soils that have (High) PM10 emissions potential are those with a surface layer that has an unfavorable particle size, high carbonates, low organic matter content, or no coarse fragment protection.

CRITERIA: Criteria are adapted from Section 618.72:  U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 2005. National Soil Survey Handbook and Carvacho, etal; 2001, Relationship Between San Joaquin Valley Soil Texture And Pm10 Emission Potential Using The UC Davis Dust Re-suspension Test Chamber.

Logic:  The model first coverts the soil's Carvacho PM10 index into a potential and then adjusts the potential for the armoring effect of coarse fragment and/or aggregate stability contributed to organic matter content.  An example would be soils with high silt or clay content would have ""High"" intrinsic PM10 potential unless they also have a high content of coarse fragment or organic matter.  In this case, the PM10 potential would not be as great and would be reduced.

Where: the soil moisture regime is aridic (torric), ustic, or xeric 

AND

1.  Potential source PM 10:  The soils PM10 index describes the soil's potential has a source of PM10 particulate material in the air.  The higher index has the greater potential for the soil to release PM10 into the air.  For this model 85% of the soils PM10 potential is attributed to surface particle size.  Thus the maximum potential due to particle size is 0.85.

Summary:  Air Quality; PM2.5 Potential (TX) interpretive model evaluates a soil's potential as a source of PM2.5 airborne particulates.  The potential assumes that the area being affected is dry, bare, smooth, and has a long distance that is exposed to the wind.

OVERVIEW:  Air quality is a function of PM2.5 and smaller particles that are held in airborne suspension.  Sources of these particles are smoke, exhaust and industrial emission, dust from roads and agricultural activities.  This suite of soil interpretations address the potential of soils used for the production of food and fiber to contribute to airborne PM2.5 concentrations.

CONCEPTS:  There are intrinsic properties of the soil and climate that facilitate the transport of airborne dust and particles less then or equal to 10 micrometers (PM2.5).  For agricultural lands, those used for the production of food, fiber, and/or grazing lands, these intrinsic properties are:
	
	1.	Climate
		a.	Wind Velocity which creates saltation impact velocities => .3 m sec-1.  Data source wind rose from WCC.  Could be linked to MLRA units?
		b.	Moisture regime that include aridic, torric, ustic, and xeric.
		c.	Other to be defined during field testing and evaluation.
	
	2.	Soil
		a.	Surface particle size (source)
		b.	Surface carbonates (source and process catalyst)
		c.	Surface salt (source and process catalyst)
		d.	Surface Organic Matter content (impedes the process)
		e.	Surface coarse fragments (impedes the process)
		f.	Other to be defined during field testing and evaluation.

The relationship of these intrinsic properties to the soils potential for providing a source of PM2.5 particulates has been tentatively established by various researchers.  The interpretation in the Air Quality Soil Interpretive Suite is an initial effort to adapt the research results to a soil interpretive model which derives its inputs for the areas of concerns SSURGO data.  

These interpretive models are NOT DESIGNED to quantify PM2.5 airborne particles from agricultural lands but to identify those areas that have potential to emit PM2.5 particles and to describe that potential on a scale of 0 (no potential) to 1.00 (highest potential).  It must be understood that a soil with the highest potential to emit PM2.5 particles may not be a contributing source if vegetated, wet, or protected when wind velocity exceed those that initiate saltation and transport of PM2.5 particles.  But, it still has an inherent potential to emit PM2.5 particles.

INTERPRETIVE MODEL OUTLINE AND SPECIFICATION:
	
	1.	Assumption and Conditions:
		a.	The soil surface is bare  (Conventional till or No-till) should interpretations be based on practice?  No-till not a source, conventional till is a source.  Should credit be given to No-till of reducing PM2.5 and PM2.5 emissions
		b.	The soil surface is dry
		c.	The soil surface is smooth
		d.	Soil is dry
		e.	Wind velocities exceed those needed to begin saltation and generate a saltation impact velocity of .3 m sec-1: Hagen; 1995
		f.	Interpretations are applicable to mineral soils only.
		g.	Soils with a rating of 1.0 have very high potential as a source of PM2.5.  These soils have a high PM2.5 index plus surface catalyst (salt or carbonates) and no mediating factors (high OM or coarse fragments).
		h.	Soils with a rating of 0.0 have a low potential as a source of PM2.5 emissions.
		i.	PM2.5 particles are fine silt and clay.
	
	2.	Soil properties considered :
	a.	OM content:
		i.	0 to 2% no mediation
		ii.	2 to 6 % moderate mediation
		iii.	6% high mediation
	b.	Coarse Fragments:
		i.	0 to 15% no mediation
		ii.	15 to 35% moderate mediation less one class
		iii.	35 to 60% high mediation less two classes
		iv.	60% very high mediation (not a source)
	c.	Surface CaCO3 and surface texture not sand: Zobeck, etal; May 1999.
		i.	0 to 5% no effect
		ii.	5 to 15% moderate increase source potential
		iii.	15% high increase source potential
	
	3.	Model design:  A The PM2.5 index is adjusted for ancillary surface properties.  A plus adjustment (potential increase in source emissions) is made for surface CaCO3 and a minus adjustment (potential decrease in source emissions) is made for surface coarse fragments and/or organic matter content.
		i.	PM2.5 index (Carvacho etal, 2001) Average of sand and clay regressions where PM2.5 index = 2.000 - 0.014 * sand% and PM2.5 index = 0.711 + 0.022 * clay% produce a smooth index based on both soil's surface sand and clay particle size.
		
Scope: The PM2.5 particulate potential of the soil is attributed to those soil surface properties that by themselves or in combination with others contribute to the soil potential as a source of PM2.5 particulate matter.  Those soil surface attributes that contribute to the soil's PM2.5 potential are particle size and carbonate content.  Conversely, soil surface attributes that reduce the potential are organic matter content and coarse fragments.  The soil's PM2.5 potential is the interaction of those soil surface features.

The soil's potential as a PM2.5 source is expressed as a number between 1.0 (Highest potential for PM2.5 emissions) and 0.0 (lowest potential for PM2.5 emissions).  The potential will range from ""Very high"" to ""very low"" (numerically 1.0 to 0.0).  Soils that have favorable surface particle size, high organic matter content, or armoring coarse fragments will have (Low) PM2.5 emissions potential.  Soils that have (High) PM2.5 emissions potential are those with a surface layer that has an unfavorable particle size, high carbonates, low organic matter content, or no coarse fragment protection.

CRITERIA: Criteria are adapted from Section 618.72:  U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 2005. National Soil Survey Handbook and Carvacho, etal; 2001, Relationship Between San Joaquin Valley Soil Texture And Pm10 Emission Potential Using The UC Davis Dust Re-suspension Test Chamber.

Logic:  The model first coverts the soil's Carvacho PM2.5 index into a potential and then adjusts the potential for the armoring effect of coarse fragment and/or aggregate stability contributed to organic matter content.  An example would be soils with high silt or clay content would have ""High"" intrinsic PM2.5 potential unless they also have a high content of coarse fragment or organic matter.  In this case, the PM2.5 potential would not be as great and would be reduced.

Revised 12-3-2008 rdn, jdw, elg

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS - Surface Drains"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for conservation systems that involve the movement or conveyance of surface water across the landscape.  Such conveyances are graded ditches, grassed waterways, terraces, diversions, etc.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limited condition) and 1.0 (limited condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater than zero, then that soil property is limited and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less than the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

Scope: The soil interpretation for WMS- Surface Drains is designed to be used as a tool in evaluating and identifying soil limitations for the installation and performance of surface drainage systems involving construction of earthen drainage ditches, channels, diversions, terraces, etc that involve <2 ft of cut. As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its undisturbed condition and does not consider present land use. The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties on installation and function of these systems. Where there is concern about construction of drainage structures that involve > 2 ft of cut, soil should be checked for bedrock or other restriction to planned excavation depth. 

Description: Soil properties and qualities that affect construction and performance of Surface Drain Structures (Ditch, Channel, or Ridge) are slope, flooding, ponding, surface and subsurface permeability, surface coarse fragments, depth to restrictive feature (bedrock, pan, or dense layer), salinity, gypsum, and susceptibility to water erosion.

Edited 12/2008

Summary:

The ENG - Septic Tank Absorption Fields (TX) interpretation is designed to inform the user of soil limitations affecting the installation and function of septic tank absorption fields in the state of Texas.  The criteria are based on an interpretation of Texas Commission on Environmental Quality - TCEQ; Chapter 285 and are not intended to replace or supersede those rules or criteria.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Septic Tank Absorption Fields"".  If a soil's property within 45cm (18 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Septic Tank Absorption Fields"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.  

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are ""not limited"" (rating index = 0), ""somewhat limited"" (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or ""very limited"" (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Septic tank absorption fields are subsurface systems of tile or perforated pipe that distribute effluent from a septic tank into the natural soil.  The centerline depth of the tile is assumed to be 18 inches or deeper.  Only the soil between depths of 18 and 60 inches is considered in making the ratings.  Soil properties and site features considered are those that affect the absorption of the effluent, those that affect the construction and maintenance of the system, and those that may affect public health.

Scope: Texas

Farm and ranch homesteads, outbuildings, and recreational facilities require a means to safely dispose of effluent.  Septic Tank Absorption Field interpretations are a tool for guiding the user in site selection for safe disposal of household effluent.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage to the soil surface, and contamination of streams from surface drainage or flood water.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Soil properties and qualities that affect the absorption of the effluent are depth to a seasonal high water table, depth to bedrock, depth to a cemented pan, and susceptibility to flooding or ponding.  Shallow depth to bedrock, ice, or a cemented pan interferes with installation.  Excessive slope may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the effluent in down-slope areas.  In addition, soil erosion is a hazard where absorption fields are installed in steep soils.
 
Some soils are underlain by loose sand and gravel or fractured bedrock at a depth less than 2 feet below the distribution lines.  In these soils, the absorption field may not adequately filter the effluent, particularly when the system is new; consequently, ground water supplies may be contaminated.
 
Texas Department of Environmental Quality publishes criteria and rule governing the installation of Septic Tank Absorption Fields.  The rules and criteria are contained in ""Texas Commission on Environmental Quality - TCEQ; Chapter 285: On-Site Sewage Facilities.""

Summary:  Soil interpretations for ""URB - Dwellings on Concrete Slab (TX)"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for construction and stability of dwellings on a concrete slab with spread footing on the perimeter.  Dwellings built on concrete slabs with spread footing are urban and rural residential structures.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

The degree of limitation is expressed as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property has a degree of limitation greater than zero, that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less than the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes according to their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

Scope:  The soil interpretation ""URB - Dwellings on Concrete Slab (TX)"" is designed to be used as a tool in evaluating and identifying soil limitations for construction and stability of dwellings on a concrete slab with spread footing on the perimeter.  Concrete slab construction is a poured concrete slab 3 to 6 inches thick that is supported by concrete spread footings that are installed to a depth of 15 to 30cm (6 to 12 inches).  The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties on installation and maintenance of concrete slab residential structures.

Description:  Soil properties and qualities that affect installation and maintenance of residential dwellings are those that influence the ease of excavation, grading, flooding, and stability.  The properties and qualities that affect the ease of excavation and grading are depth and hardness and bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, flooding, the amount of large stones, and slope.  The properties that affect the soils ability to support the structure are soil strength as inferred from shrink-swell behavior, subsidence, and depth to the seasonal high water table.  The properties that affect maintenance or durability of the base slab and spread footings are shrink-swell, pH, and subsidence.

Criteria: The interpretive rating is the most limited of the following restrictive features.

1.  Depth to cemented pan: Shallow depth to cemented pan limits site preparation such as shaping and leveling.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

		Not limiting		=> 75cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
5.  Flooding: Flooding from stream overflow, runoff, or high tides adversely affects the use and management of these areas.  Flooding delays use of the area until the floodwater has receded and the soils have dried sufficiently to allow renewed activity.

Summary: Wildlife habitat suitability interpretations provide a tool for habitat management.  Soils vary in their capacity to produce climatically adapted plants for use as wildlife habitat and are used as habitat by specific animal species.  The ratings reflect the suitability of the soil to support climatically adapted wildlife habitat elements.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The ratings are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, water sources, and the presence or absence of wildlife in the area.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items. 

The degree of limitation is expressed as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications. 

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0). 

Scope: Desertic Herbaceous Plants rate the soil as a medium for growing a diverse desertic herbaceous plant community.  The plants are adapted to an arid or semiarid environment that is drier than that common to moist riparian and wetland zones and subhumid, humid, or tropical areas.  These upland desertic herbaceous plant species are predominantly xerophytic and include some mesophytic plants that are common along the transitional areas adjacent to riparian or wetland areas. 

The adapted vegetation species are selected to meet the specific local habitat requirements for targeted and non-targeted species of wildlife.  The Desertic Herbaceous Plants interpretation provides ratings for the growing and managing desertic herbaceous plants as upland wildlife habitat and not to reflect commercial or livestock grazing values. 

This interpretation rates and identifies the dominant soil characteristics that limit the establishment and growth of desertic wild herbaceous vegetation, either naturally or artificially established.  This information allows the user to plan and develop alternatives in site selection and to identify the desertic herbaceous species that best meet the wildlife habitat requirements. Selection is made from a list of locally adapted desertic herbaceous species that are drought resistant.  Included in the list are native and introduced species and their ability to adapt to each restrictive feature. 

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no limitations to use and are favorable for all locally adapted desertic herbaceous species that are used as wildlife habitat.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has restrictions for the establishment or growth of climatically adapted desertic herbaceous species and some restrictions may limit their full potential for plant growth.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit establishment, growth, maintenance, or performance and thus affect the value of desertic herbaceous vegetation as wildlife habitat.  Existing tree and shrub cover should not influence the ratings. 

The management, reestablishment, or introduction of native desertic herbaceous species to provide a diverse vegetation community that meets select wildlife requirements is determined by a number of factors.  The factors are landscape, climate, soil, vegetation, hydrology, and time.  A limitation caused by any one of these factors can influence the adaptability, survival, growth, and vigor of the herbaceous species.  This addresses only those factors that relate primarily to the soil.  It identifies the limitation and the soil restricting features that will have the most affect on the establishment and use of desertic herbaceous vegetation as wildlife habitat. 

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in establishment and growth of ""Upland Desertic Shrubs and Trees"" are available water holding capacity, wetness, sodium and salt content, surface texture, coarse fragments, and pH. 

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features. 

1.  Wetness:  A seasonal high water table can affect plant growth and survival.  It results in poorly aerated soils which restrict root respiration and total plant growth.  Species that are tolerant to wetness are more desirable for establishing wildlife habitat.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month. 

        Property used: WTTP-DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM (Modality - representative value) 

        Restrictive limits:
                 Limiting                =< 45cm
                 Somewhat limiting        > 45 to < 90cm
                 Not limiting            => 90cm 

        Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class. 

2.  Droughty: A low available water capacity means that the ability of the soil to provide continual moisture to desertic herbaceous plants is lower than is necessary for the plants to establish or survive naturally.  Drought-resistant herbaceous species should be planted or irrigation should be planned for stand establishment and maintenance. 

        Property used: WTTP-AVAILABLE WATER CAPACITY IN DEPTH 0-100cm (Modality - high, low, representative value) 

        Restrictive limits:
                 Somewhat limiting       =< 5cm
                 Not limiting             > 5cm 

        Null awc is assigned to the Not rated class. 

3.  Sodium content: High concentrations of exchangeable sodium in the upper 50cm cause poor physical soil conditions that restrict the growth of plants.  Crusting and blocked pores reduce air movement and soil permeability.  Soil amendments can sometimes alleviate the problem, but it is often better to select a new site. 

        Property used: WTTP-SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-50cm (Modality - low, high, representative value) 

        Restriction limits:
                 Limiting                => 30
                 Somewhat limiting        > 13 to < 30
                 Not limiting            <= 13 

        Null SAR is assigned not rated. 

4.  Extreme soil temperature:  Soil temperatures that are too hot or too cold or that are too cool during the growing season restrict the growth of desertic shrub vegetation.  Native desertic shrub species are usually the best alternative species to select for wildlife habitat. 

        Property used:  WTTP-TAXONOMIC TEMPERATURE CLASS (Modality - representative value) 

        Restriction limits:
                 Somewhat limiting        = ""cryic"" or ""hyperthermic""
                 Not limiting             = all others 

                Null soil temperature is assigned to the Not limiting class. 

5.  Too Gravelly, Cobbly, or Stony: A high concentration of rock fragments adversely affects seedbed preparation.  Natural regeneration and intensive management that protects and enhances the herbaceous species are the best alternative practices. 

        Property used: WTTP-FRAGMENTS > 2mm SURFACE LAYER (Modality - high, low, and representative value)

          Restrictive limits:
                 Limiting                 = 100%
                 Somewhat limiting         > 50% to < 100%
                 Not limiting             =< 50% 

        Null passing  10 sieve, fragments greater then 250mm, or fragments between 75 and 250mm data are assigned to the Not rated class. 

6.  Excess salt: Excess water-soluble salts restrict the growth of most plants.  They also reduce viable seed germination and seedling survival.  The selection and management of plant species that are tolerant of saline conditions can minimize the effect of the salts. 

        Property used: WTTP-SALINITY MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-50CM (Modality - low, high, representative value) 

        Restriction limits:
                 Limiting                => 16
                 Somewhat limiting        > 4 to < 16
                 Not limiting            =< 4 

        Null EC is assigned not rated. 

7.  Too alkaline: Soils that are too alkaline restrict plant growth and species composition.  Alkaline soils have low amounts of phosphorus, iron, manganese, baron and zinc available to plants.  The addition of soil amendments and/or the selection of species that are tolerant to alkaline conditions are management considerations. 

        Property used: WTTP-SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MAXIMUM, 0 TO 50CM (Modality - high, low, representative value) 

        Restriction limits:
                 Limiting                => 9.1
                 Somewhat limiting        > 8.3 to < 9.1
                 Not limiting            =< 8.3 

        Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class. 

8.  Too clayey: Clayey surface layers are slippery and sticky when wet, are slow to dry, and, when dry, are usually hard.  Timing and techniques that are used in preparing a seedbed and in planting the seeds, mechanical manipulation, and large animal hoof impact are affected.  Hard surfaces affect seedling emergence and survival. 

        Property used: WTTP-CLAY PERCENT SURFACE LAYER (Modality - high, low, representative value) 

        Restriction limits:
                 Somewhat limiting       >= 40%
                 Not limiting             > 40% 

        Null clay percentage is assigned to the Not rated class. 

9. Sandy surface: Sandy surface layers are soft and loose, droughty, and generally low in fertility.  Seedling emergence and survival are adversely affected.  Selecting or managing the most drought-resistant species as ground cover is the best alternative. 

        Property used: WTTP-USDA TEXTURE SURFACE LAYER (Modality - representative value) 

        Restrictive limits:
                 Somewhat limiting       ""COS"", ""S""

The factors are landscape, climate, soil, vegetation, hydrology, and time.  A limitation caused by any one of these factors can influence the adaptability, survival, growth, and vigor of the shrub and tree species.  The ""Upland Desertic Shrubs and Trees"" interpretation addresses only those soil factors that limit the site's use for adapted upland desertic shrub or tree vegetation as wildlife habitat. 

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in establishment and growth of """"Upland Desertic Shrubs and Trees"""" are available water holding capacity, wetness, sodium and salt content, surface texture, coarse fragments, pH, and temperature extremes.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features. 

1.  Depth to saturated zone: A seasonal high water table can affect tree and shrub growth and survival.  It results in poorly aerated soils.  The selection of tree and shrub species that are tolerant of soil wetness is desirable for establishing wildlife habitat.

                 Not limiting            => 150cm 

        Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class. 

2.  Droughty: A low available water capacity means that the ability of the soil to provide continual moisture to upland plants is lower than is necessary for establish or survive naturally.  Drought- resistant species should be planted or supplemental irrigation should be planned for stand establishment and maintenance. 

        Property used: WTTP-AVAILABLE WATER CAPACITY IN DEPTH 0-100cm (Modality - high, low, representative value) 

        Restrictive limits:

                 Not limiting                > 5cm 

        Null awc is assigned to the Not rated class. 

3.  Sodium content: High concentrations of exchangeable sodium in the upper 50cm cause poor physical soil conditions that restrict the growth of plants.  Crusting and blocked pores reduce air movement and soil permeability.  Soil amendments can sometimes alleviate the problem, but it is often better to select a new site. 

        Property used: WTTP-SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-50cm (Modality - low, high, representative value)

        Null SAR is assigned not rated. 

4.  Extreme soil temperature:  Soil temperatures that are too hot or too cold or that are too cool during the growing season restrict the growth of desertic shrub vegetation.  Native desertic shrub species are usually the best alternative species to select for wildlife habitat. 

        Property used:  WTTP-TAXONOMIC TEMPERATURE CLASS (Modality - representative value) 

        Restriction limits:
                 Somewhat limiting        = ""cryic"" or ""hyperthermic""
                 Not limiting             = all others 

                Null soil temperature is assigned to the Not limiting class. 

5.  Too Gravelly, Cobbly, or Stony: A high concentration of rock fragments adversely affects seedbed preparation.  Natural regeneration and intensive management that protects and enhances the herbaceous species are the best alternative practices. 

        Property used: WTTP-FRAGMENTS > 2mm SURFACE LAYER (Modality - high, low, and representative value) 

        Restrictive limits:
                 Limiting                 = 100%

                 Not limiting             =< 50% 

        Null passing  10 sieve, fragments greater then 250mm, or fragments between 75 and 250mm data are assigned to the Not rated class. 

6.  Excess salt: Excess water-soluble salts restrict the growth of most plants.  They also reduce viable seed germination and seedling survival.  The selection and management of plant species that are tolerant of saline conditions can minimize the effect of the salts. 

        Property used: WTTP-SALINITY MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-50CM (Modality - low, high, representative value) 

        Restriction limits:

                 Not limiting            =< 4 

        Null EC is assigned not rated. 

7.  Too alkaline: Soils that are too alkaline restrict plant growth and species composition.  Alkaline soils have low amounts of phosphorus, iron, manganese, baron and zinc available to plants.  The addition of soil amendments and/or the selection of species that are tolerant to alkaline conditions are management considerations. 

        Property used: WTTP-SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MAXIMUM, 0 TO 50CM (Modality - high, low, representative value) 

        Restriction limits:

        Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class. 

8.  Too clayey: Clayey surface layers are slippery and sticky when wet, are slow to dry, and, when dry, are usually hard.  Timing and techniques that are used in preparing a seedbed and in planting the seeds, mechanical use, and large animal hoof impact are affected. Hard surfaces affect seedling emergence and survival.  These factors should be considered in selecting alternatives for use and management.

        Null clay percentage is assigned to the Not rated class. 


9. Too sandy: Sandy surface layers are soft and loose, droughty, and generally low in fertility.  Planting techniques, seedling emergence, and survival are adversely affected. Soil feature considered is the rv or first USDA Texture class of the surface layer.

Summary: Wildlife habitat suitability interpretations provide a tool for habitat management.  Soils vary in their capacity to produce climatically adapted plants for use as wildlife habitat and are used as habitat by specific animal species.  The ratings reflect the suitability of the soil to support climatically adapted wildlife habitat elements.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The ratings are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, water sources, and the presence or absence of wildlife in the area.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items. 

The degree of limitation is expressed as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications. 

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0). 

Scope: The ""Upland Shrubs and Vines"" rate the soil as a medium for growing a diverse upland shrub and vine community. The plants are adapted to soil conditions that are drier than those common in the moist riparian and wetland zones but that are not as dry as those in the upland desert area. 

These upland shrub and vine plant species are predominantly mesophytic and xerophytic and include some hydrophytic plants that are common in areas adjacent to riparian or wetland areas.  The adapted vegetation components are selected to meet the specific local food and cover habitat requirements for targeted and nontargeted species of wildlife.  The Upland Shrubs and Vines ratings are intended to provide minimum soil restriction guidelines for the selection of sites for growing and managing upland shrubs and/or vines as wildlife habitat and not to reflect commercial or livestock grazing value. 

This interpretation provides generalized ratings and identifies the dominant soil characteristics that limit the site for growing upland shrub and/or vine vegetation, either naturally or artificially established.  This information allows the user to plan and develop alternatives in site selection and to identify the upland shrubs and vines that best meet the wildlife habitat requirements. Selection is made from a list of locally adapted upland shrub and vine species.  Included in the list are native and introduced species, their suitability ratings, and their ability to adapt to each restrictive feature. 

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITED have no use restrictions and are favorable for all locally adapted upland shrub and vine species that are used as wildlife habitat.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITED rating implies that the site has restrictions for the establishment or growth of climatically adapted upland shrub and vine species for habitat and some restrictive features may limit their full potential for plant growth.  A VERY LIMITED rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit establishment, growth, maintenance, or performance and thus affect the value of the upland shrub and vine vegetation as wildlife habitat.  Existing tree cover should not influence the rating. 

Description: The management, reestablishment, or introduction of introduced or native upland shrub and vine species to provide a diverse vegetation community that meets select wildlife requirements is determined by a number of factors.  These factors are landscape, climate, soil, vegetation, hydrology, and time.  A limitation caused by any one of these factors can influence the adaptability, survival, growth, and vigor of the woody species.  This interpretation addresses only those factors that relate primarily to the soil.  It identifies the limitation and the soil restricting features that will have the most affect on the use of upland shrub and vine vegetation as wildlife habitat. 

The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of ""Upland Shrubs and Vines"" are surface texture, organic matter content, rock fragment, depth, available water holding capacity, wetness, salts, sodium adsorption ratio, and extreme climatic conditions. 

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features. 

1.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's water holding capacity and the thickness of the root zone. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock*"".  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

                 Not limiting            => 100cm 

        Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class. 

        2.  Depth to cemented pan: Shallow depth to cemented pan limits the soil's water holding capacity and the thickness of the root zone.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

Scope: Upland Wild Herbaceous Plants For Use As Wildlife Habitat interpretation ranks the soil as a medium for growing a diverse upland herbaceous plant community which is adapted to soil conditions that are drier than those common in the moist riparian and wetland zones but that are not as dry as those in the upland desert areas. 

The ""Upland Native Herbaceous Plants"" rating is of a more general nature.  It identifies the dominant soil characteristics that influence the suitability of the site for growing upland native herbaceous vegetation, either naturally or artificially established. This information allows the user to plan and develop alternatives in site selection and to identify the upland herbaceous plants that best meet the wildlife habitat requirements.  It is intended to provide minimum soil restriction guidelines for the selection of sites for growing and managing adapted herbaceous plants as upland wildlife habitat and not to reflect commercial or livestock grazing values.  Selection is made from a user defined list of locally adapted upland herbaceous species.  Included in the list are native and introduced species, their suitability ratings, and their ability to adapt to each restrictive feature.  These upland herbaceous plant species are predominantly mesophytic and xerophytic and include some hydrophytic plants that are common in areas adjacent to riparian or wetland areas.  The adapted vegetation components are selected to meet the specific local habitat requirements for targeted and non-targeted species of wildlife. 

The management, reestablishment, or introduction of native upland herbaceous species to provide a diverse vegetation community that meets select wildlife requirements is determined by a number of factors.  The factors are landscape, climate, soil, vegetation, hydrology, and time.  A limitation caused by any one of these factors can influence the adaptability, survival, growth, and vigor of the herbaceous species. 

Soils that are rated NOT LIMITING have no restrictions to use and are favorable for all locally adapted upland herbaceous species that are used as wildlife habitat.  A SOMEWHAT LIMITING rating implies that the site has restrictions for the establishment or growth of climatically adapted upland herbaceous species for habitat and some restrictive features may limit their full potential for plant growth. A VERY LIMITING rating indicates that the soil characteristics are such that they limit establishment, growth, maintenance, or performance and thus affect the value of the upland herbaceous vegetation as wildlife habitat.  Existing tree and shrub cover should not influence the ratings. 

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of ""Upland Native Herbaceous Plants"", are soil temperature, available water holding capacity, wetness, coarse fragments in the surface, salts, moisture regime, and surface clay or sand content.  The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are salinity, wetness, and available water holding capacity. 

Criteria: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features. 

1.  Wetness:  A seasonal high water table can affect plant growth and survival.  It results in poorly aerated soils which restrict root respiration and total plant growth.  Species that are tolerant to wetness are more desirable for establishing wildlife habitat.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month.

        Null SAR is assigned not rated. 

4.  Extreme soil temperature:  Soil temperatures that are too cold cause permafrost, and soil temperatures that are too cool during the growing season restrict tree, shrub, and herbaceous species growth.  The selection of native species is usually the best alternative for wildlife habitat.

Summary:

The ENG - Septic Tank Leaching Chamber (TX) interpretation is designed to inform the user of soil limitations affecting the installation and function of septic tank leaching chambers in the state of Texas.  The criteria are based on an interpretation of Texas Commission on Environmental Quality - TCEQ; Chapter 285 and are not intended to replace or supersede those rules or criteria.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Septic Tank Leaching Chambers"".  If a soil's property within 45cm (18 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Septic Tank Leaching Chambers"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.  

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are ""not limited"" (rating index = 0), ""somewhat limited"" (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or ""very limited"" (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Septic tank leaching chambers are similar to an absorptive drainfield, however, the effluent is deposited into bottomless chambers that are linked together with solid walled pipe and are allowed a reduction in the absorptive drainfield sizing formula.  The centerline depth of the chambers is assumed to be 18 inches or deeper.  Only the soil between depths of 18 and 60 inches is considered in making the ratings.  Soil properties and site features considered are those that affect the absorption of the effluent, those that affect the construction and maintenance of the system, and those that may affect public health.

Scope: Texas

Farm and ranch homesteads, outbuildings, and recreational facilities require a means to safely dispose of effluent.  Septic Tank Leaching Chamber interpretations are a tool for guiding the user in site selection for safe disposal of household effluent.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage to the soil surface, and contamination of streams from surface drainage or flood water.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Soil properties and qualities that affect the absorption of the effluent are depth to a seasonal high water table, depth to bedrock, depth to a cemented pan, and susceptibility to flooding or ponding.  Shallow depth to bedrock, ice, or a cemented pan interferes with installation.  Excessive slope may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the effluent in down-slope areas.  In addition, soil erosion is a hazard where absorption fields are installed in steep soils.
 
Some soils are underlain by loose sand and gravel or fractured bedrock at a depth less than 2 feet below the distribution lines.  In these soils, the absorption field may not adequately filter the effluent, particularly when the system is new; consequently, ground water supplies may be contaminated.

"TX201"|"URB - Concrete Driveways and Sidewalks (TX)"|"limitation"|"URB - Concrete Driveways and Sidewalks (TX)

Summary:  Soil interpretations for ""URB - Concrete Driveways and Sidewalks (TX)"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for installation and performance of concrete driveways and sidewalks.  Concrete driveways and sidewalks are infrastructure component of both urban and rural residential structures.  These systems are designed to facilitate traffic flow to and from the residence.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

The degree of limitation is expressed as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition). If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater than zero, that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less than the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes according to their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

Scope:  The soil interpretation ""URB - Concrete Driveways and Sidewalks (TX) is designed to be used as a tool in evaluating and identifying soil limitations for installation and performance of driveways and sidewalks.  Concrete driveways and sidewalks are all weather vehicle and pedestrian traffic structures made of poured concrete slabs and are between 3 and 6 inches thick.  As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its undisturbed condition and does not consider present land use.  The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties on installation and performance of concrete slab driveways and sidewalks.

Description:  Soil properties and qualities that affect installation and performance of concrete driveways and sidewalks are those that influence the ease of excavation and grading and the traffic-supporting capacity.  The properties and qualities that affect the ease of excavation and grading are hardness and depth of bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, flooding, the amount of large stones, and slope.  The properties that affect traffic-supporting capacity are soil strength as inferred from the AASHTO group index, shrink-swell behavior, subsidence, and depth to the seasonal high water table.  The properties that affect performance or durability of driveways and sidewalks are shrink-swell, pH, and subsidence.

Criteria: The interpretive rating is the most limited of the following restrictive features.

"TX201"|"URB - Reinforced Concrete Slab (TX)"|"limitation"|"URB - Reinforced Concrete Slab (TX)

Summary:  Soil interpretations for ""URB - Reinforced Concrete Slab (TX)"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for installation and performance of concrete slabs.  Concrete slabs are 4 to 6 inches thick concrete infrastructure component of both urban and rural structures.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

The degree of limitation is expressed as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition). If a soil's property within 100 cm (40 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater than zero, that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less than the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes according to their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

Scope:  The soil interpretation ""URB - Concrete Driveways and Sidewalks (TX)"" is designed to be used as a tool in evaluating and identifying soil limitations for installation and performance of driveways and sidewalks.  Concrete driveways and sidewalks are all weather vehicle and pedestrian traffic structures made of poured concrete slabs and are between 3 and 6 inches thick.  As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its undisturbed condition and does not consider present land use.  The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties on installation and performance of concrete slab driveways and sidewalks.

Description:  Soil properties and qualities that affect installation and performance of reinforced concrete slabs are those that influence the ease of excavation and grading and the traffic-supporting capacity.  The properties and qualities that affect the ease of excavation and grading are hardness and depth of bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, flooding, the amount of large stones, and slope.  The properties that affect traffic-supporting capacity are soil strength as inferred from the AASHTO group index, shrink-swell behavior, subsidence, and depth to the seasonal high water table.  The properties that affect performance or durability of driveways and sidewalks are shrink-swell, pH, and subsidence.

The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties on installation and maintenance of concrete slab commerical structures.

Description:  Soil properties and qualities that affect installation and maintenance of commerical metal buildings are those that influence the ease of excavation, grading, flooding, and stability.  The properties and qualities that affect the ease of excavation and grading are depth and hardness and depth of bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, flooding, the amount of large stones, and slope.  The properties that affect the soils ability to support the structure are soil strength as inferred from the AASHTO group index, shrink-swell behavior, subsidence, and depth to the seasonal high water table.  The properties that affect maintenance or durability of the base slab and spread footings are shrink-swell, pH, and subsidence.

Summary: URB - Lawns and Ornamental Plantings (TX) interpretation provide a tool for the soil's capacity to grasses planted for lawns and ornamental shrubs, tress, and other herbaceous vegetation.  The ratings reflect the suitability of the soil to support climatically adapted vegetation and restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The ratings are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

The degree of limitation is expressed as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications. 

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0). 

Scope: Lawns and Ornamental Plantings interpretation ranks the soil as a medium for growing a diverse selection of grasses and ornamental plantings in a residential setting.  It identifies the dominant soil characteristics that limit the site for growing and maintaining a lawn and ornamental tress and shrubs.  It is intended to provide minimum soil restriction guidelines for the selection of grass and ornamental species used for landscaping.  Selection is made from a user defined list of locally adapted plants.

Description: The soil properties and qualities considered in rating soils for lawns and ornamental plantings include those that affect growth and trafficability after vegetation is established.  The properties that affect plant growth are the content of salt, sodium, or calcium carbonate; sulfidic materials; soil reaction; depth to the water table; depth to bedrock or a cemented pan; and the available water capacity in the upper 40 inches of soil.  The properties that affect trafficability after vegetation is established are flooding, wetness, slope, stoniness, and the amount of clay, sand, or organic matter in the surface layer.

Edited 6/2009

Summary:

The ENG - Septic Tanks, Gravity Disposal (TX) interpretation is designed to inform the user of soil limitations affecting the installation and function of septic tanks, gravity disposal systems in the state of Texas.  The criteria are based on an interpretation of Texas Commission on Environmental Quality - TCEQ; Chapter 285 and are not intended to replace or supersede those rules or criteria.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Septic Tanks, Gravity Disposal"".  If a soil's property within 45cm (18 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Septic Tanks, Gravity Disposal"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.  

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are ""not limited"" (rating index = 0), ""somewhat limited"" (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or ""very limited"" (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Septic tanks, gravity disposal are gravity absorptive drain fields or bottomless chambers that are linked together with solid walled pipe.  These gravity disposal systems allow effluent to percolate through an absorptive drain field for treatment.  The centerline depth is assumed to be 18 inches or deeper.  Only the soil between depths of 18 and 60 inches is considered in making the ratings.  Soil properties and site features considered are those that affect the absorption of the effluent, those that affect the construction and maintenance of the system, and those that may affect public health.

Scope: Texas

Farm and ranch homesteads, outbuildings, and recreational facilities require a means to safely dispose of effluent.  Septic Tanks, Gravity Disposal interpretations are a tool for guiding the user in site selection for safe disposal of household effluent.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage to the soil surface, and contamination of streams from surface drainage or flood water.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Soil properties and qualities that affect the absorption of the effluent are depth to a seasonal high water table, depth to bedrock, depth to a cemented pan, and susceptibility to flooding or ponding.  Shallow depth to bedrock, ice, or a cemented pan interferes with installation.  Excessive slope may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the effluent in down-slope areas.  In addition, soil erosion is a hazard where absorption fields are installed in steep soils.
 
Some soils are underlain by loose sand and gravel or fractured bedrock at a depth less than 2 feet below the distribution lines.  In these soils, the absorption field may not adequately filter the effluent, particularly when the system is new; consequently, ground water supplies may be contaminated.
 
Texas Department of Environmental Quality publishes criteria and rule governing the installation of Septic Tanks, Gravity Disposal.  The rules and criteria are contained in ""Texas Commission on Environmental Quality - TCEQ; Chapter 285: On-Site Sewage Facilities.""

Summary:

The ENG - Septic System; Disinfection, Surface Application (TX) interpretation is designed to inform the user of soil limitations affecting the installation and function of drip irrigation treatment of effluent in the state of Texas.  The criteria are based on an interpretation of Texas Commission on Environmental Quality - TCEQ; Chapter 285 and are not intended to replace or supersede those rules or criteria.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""ENG - Septic System; Disinfection, Surface Application.""  If a soil's property within 30cm (12 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""ENG - Septic System; Disinfection, Surface Application"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.  

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are ""not limited"" (rating index = 0), ""somewhat limited"" (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or ""very limited"" (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Septic System; Disinfection, Surface Application are surface application systems consisting of small diameter pressurized lines containing pressure reducing emitters that distribute disinfected effluent on the soil surface.  The system is a evapotransportion system that utilitzes vegetative and evaporation to treat and utilitzation of effulent.

Scope: Texas

Farm and ranch homesteads, outbuildings, and recreational facilities require a means to safely dispose of effluent.  Septic System; Disinfection, Surface Application interpretation is a tool for guiding the user in site selection for safe disposal of household effluent.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage to the soil surface, and contamination of streams from surface drainage or flood water.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Soil properties and qualities that affect the treatment of the effluent are surface pH, depth to a seasonal high water table, depth to bedrock, depth to a cemented pan, and susceptibility to flooding or ponding.  Shallow depth to bedrock, ice, or a cemented pan interferes with installation.  Excessive slope may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the effluent in down-slope areas.  In addition, soil erosion is a hazard where absorption fields are installed in steep soils.

Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is widely used by a diverse group of service providers that include agronomist, archaeologists, criminologists, engineers, environmental specialists, foresters, geologists, geophysicists, hydrologists, land use managers, and soil scientists. In recent years, GPR has gained recognition in the search for terrorism and military hazards. A common concern of GPR service providers is whether or not GPR will be able to achieve the desired depth of penetration in the soils of a project area. In many soils, high rates of signal attenuation severely restrict penetration depths and limit the suitability of GPR for a large number of applications. In saline and sodic soils, where penetration depths are often less than 10 inches (Daniels, 2004), GPR is unsuited to most applications. In wet clays, where penetration depths are typically less than 40 inches (Doolittle et al., 2002), GPR has very low potentials for most applications. However, GPR is highly suited to most applications in dry sands and gravels, where penetration depths can exceed 160 feet with low frequency antennas (Smith and Jol, 1995). 

Most GPR service providers have limited knowledge of soils and are unable to foretell attenuation rates, penetration depths, and the general suitability of the soils within project areas to GPR. Knowledge of the probable penetration depth and the relative suitability of soils would help service providers assess the appropriateness of using GPR and the likelihood of achieving acceptable results. Soil attribute data contained in the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) and the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) data bases have been used to develop thematic maps showing, at different scales and levels of resolution, the relative suitability of soils for many GPR applications. Both STATSGO and SSURGO data bases consist of digital map data, attribute data, and Federal Geographic Data Committee compliant metadata. These data bases are linked to soil interpretation records, which contain data on the physical and chemical properties of approximately 21,000 different soils (USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service, 1994). 


Factors Influencing the Penetration Depth of GPR

The penetration depth of GPR is determined by antenna frequency and the electrical conductivity of the earthen materials being profiled (Daniels, 2004). Soils having high electrical conductivity rapidly attenuate radar energy, restrict penetration depths, and severely limit the effectiveness of GPR. The electrical conductivity of soils increases with increases in water, clay and soluble salt contents. 

Electrical conductivity is directly related to the amount, distribution, chemical composition, and phase (liquid, solid, or gas) of the soil water (McNeill, 1980). At a given frequency, the attenuation of electromagnetic energy increases with increasing moisture contents (Daniels, 2004). The lack of adequate data on soil moisture and the high spatial and temporal variations in the degree of soil wetness within most soil map units precluded the use of moisture content in the preparation of GPR soil suitability maps. As a consequence, properties selected to prepare these maps principally reflect variations in the clay and soluble salt contents of soils. These properties include clay content and mineralogy, electrical conductivity, sodium absorption ratio, and calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate contents. 

Clays have greater surface areas and can hold more water than the silt and sand fractions at moderate and higher water tensions. Because of their high adsorptive capacity for water and exchangeable cations, clays produce high attenuation losses (Daniels, 2004). As a consequence, the penetration depth of GPR is inversely related to clay content. While soils with more than 35 percent clay are restrictive, soils with less than 10 percent clay are generally favorable to deep penetration with GPR. 

Soils contain various proportions of different clay minerals (e.g., members of kaolin, mica, chlorite, vermiculite, smectite groups). The size, surface area, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), and water holding capacity of clay minerals vary greatly. Variations in electrical conductivity are attributed to differences in the CEC associated with different clay minerals (Saarenketo, 1998). Electrical conductivity increases with increasing CEC (Saarenketo, 1998). Soils with clay fractions dominated by high cation exchange capacity clays (e.g., smectitic and vermiculitic soil mineralogy classes) are more attenuating to GPR than soils with an equivalent percentage of low cation exchange capacity clays (e.g., kaolinitic, gibbsitic, and halloysitic soil mineralogy classes). Soils classified as kaolinitic, gibbsitic, and halloysitic characteristically have low cation-exchange capacity and low base saturation. As a general rule, for soils with comparable clay and moisture contents, greater depths of penetration can be achieved in highly weathered soils of tropical and subtropical regions that have kandic or oxic horizons than in soils of temperate regions that have argillic horizons. Compared with argillic horizons, kandic and oxic horizons have greater concentrations of low activity clays (Soil Survey Staff, 1999).

Electrical conductivity is directly related to the concentration of dissolved salts in the soil solution, as well as the type of exchangeable cations and the degree of dissociation of the salts on soil particles (Soil Survey Staff, 1993). The concentration of salts in the soil solution is dependent upon the degree of water-filled porosity, the soil texture, and the minerals found in soils. In semi-arid and arid regions, soluble salts and exchangeable sodium accumulate in the upper part of some soil profiles. These salts produce high attenuation losses that restrict penetration depths (Doolittle and Collins, 1995). Because of their high electrical conductivity, saline (saturated extract electrical conductivity  4 mmhos cm -1) and sodic (sodium absorption ratio  13) soils are considered unsuited to GPR. 

Calcareous and gypsiferous soils are characterized by layers with secondary accumulations of calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate, respectively. These soils mainly occur in base-rich, alkaline environments in semi-arid and arid regions. High concentrations of calcium carbonate and/or calcium sulfate imply less intense leaching, prevalence of other soluble salts, greater quantities of inherited minerals from parent rock, and accumulations of specific mineral products of weathering (Jackson, 1959). Grant and Schultz (1994) observed a reduction in the depth of GPR signal penetration in soils that have high concentrations of calcium carbonate. 

GPR Soil Indices

Soil properties selected to prepare GPR soil suitability maps are summarized in Table 1. Attribute index values (AIV) were assigned to each of the selected soil properties based on field experiences. Lower AIVs are associated with lower rates of signal attenuation, greater penetration depths, and soil properties that are characteristically more suited to GPR. For clay content, AIVs range from 1 to 5. Mineral soils with clay contents less than 10 percent in all horizons within a depth of 3.3 feet have a very high potential for most GPR applications and are assigned an AIV of 1. Mineral soils with clay contents greater than 60 percent in one or more horizons within a depth of 3.3 feet have a very low potential for most GPR applications and are assigned an index value of 5. A mineralogy override is used for highly weathered soils that are dominated by low activity clay minerals. Based on taxonomic criteria, a textural adjustment is applied to all soils that have kandic or oxic horizons and more than 10 percent clay. Fabric adjustments and separate indices are used for organic soils. Organic soils with more acidic reactions (dysic; AIV of 1) are typically more nutrient deficient and less limiting to GPR than organic soils with more neutral or alkaline soil reactions (euic; AIV of 2). Distinctions are also made for organic soils with mineral layers that are more than 12 inches thick and occur within depths of 4.1 feet (terric taxonomic subgroup). Because of their unsuitability to GPR, saline and sodic soils are assigned an AIV of 6. Based principally on taxonomic criteria, mineral soils with less than 60 percent clay that are characterized by high gypsum and/or calcium carbonate contents are assigned an added AIV of 1. Very fine textured soils (>60 percent clay) have very low potential for GPR and were not assigned this additional AIV.

For each component of a soil map unit, the most limiting condition (highest AIV) for each of the selected properties (clay content, electrical conductivity or SAR, and calcium carbonate or calcium sulfate content) at the soil horizon level is selected. These index values are summed to a depth of 3.3 feet for mineral soils and 4.1 feet for organic soils. The summation of the most limiting conditions represents the component index value (CIV). A CIV is computed for each soil in the map unit. Table 2 shows the relative composition (percentage) of different soil components and their CIVs for a hypothetical soil map unit.

A relative suitability index (SI) is computed for each map unit by summing the percentages of soils with the same CIV. Table 3 shows the results of summing the soil component percentages by the CIVs shown in Table 2. The dominant CIV is 4 for the map unit shown in Table 3. Soils with this index value make up 38 percent of the map unit. However, this map unit is also composed of soils that have more limiting (21%) and more favorable (41%) CIVs. The SI for a map unit represents the most dominant attribute properties, but does not identify or weighs the proportion of other soils that have different CIVs and occur within the map unit.

The final product is a lookup table consisting of the map unit identifiers and dominant GPR suitability indices (SI) shown in Table 4. The dominant SI for the soil components is joined to the map unit identifiers and displayed in graduated colors on digital maps. 

Relative Suitability of Soils for GPR

Soil attribute index values and relative soil suitability indices are based on observed responses from antennas with center frequencies between 100 and 200 MHz. For mineral soils, the inferred SI is based on unsaturated conditions and the absence of contrasting materials within depths of 3.3 feet. Penetration depths and the relative suitability of mineral soils will be less under saturated conditions. Contrasting physical and chemical properties will also affect attenuation rates and penetration depths.

Areas dominated by mineral soil materials with less than 10 percent clay or very deep organic soils with pH values < 4.5 in all layers have very high potential (SI of 1) for GPR applications. Areas with very high potential afford the greatest possibility for deep, high resolution profiling with GPR. However, depending on the ionic concentration of the soil solution and the amounts and types of clay minerals in the soil matrix, signal attenuation and penetration depths will vary. With a 200 MHz antenna, in soils with very high potential for GPR, the effective penetration depth has averaged about 16.5 feet. However, because of variations in textural layering, mineralogy, soil water content, and the ionic concentration of the soil water, the depth of penetration can range from 3.3 to greater than 50 feet. 

Areas dominated by mineral soils with 18 to 35 percent clay or with 35 to 60 percent clay that are mostly low-activity clay minerals have moderate potential (SI of 3) for GPR. Low activity clays are principally associated with older, more intensely weathered soils that form in materials weathered from highly permeable granitic parent rock on the Piedmont and Coastal Plains of southeastern United States. In soils with moderate potential for GPR, the effective penetration depth with a 200 MHz antenna has averaged about 7 feet with a range of about 1.6 to 16 feet. Though penetration depths are restricted, soil polygons with moderate potential are suited to many GPR applications. 

Mineral soils with 35 to 60 percent clay, or calcareous and/or gypsiferous soils with 18 to 35 percent clay have low potential (SI of 4) for GPR. Areas with low potential are very depth restrictive to GPR. In soils with low potential for GPR, the depth of penetration with a 200 MHz antenna has averaged about 1.6 feet with a range of about 0.8 to 6.5 feet. 

Areas that are unsuited (SI >5) to GPR consist of saline and sodic soils. These soil map units are principally restricted to arid and semiarid regions and coastal areas of the United States.

Summary:  Soil interpretations for ""ENG - Pier Beam Building Foundations (TX)"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for installation and performance of Pier & Beam building foundations.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

The degree of limitation is expressed as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property has a degree of limitation greater than zero, that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less than the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes according to their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

Scope:  The soil interpretation ""ENG - Pier Beam Building Foundations (TX)"" is designed to be used as a tool in evaluating and identifying soil limitations for construction and stability of Pier & Beam building foundations.  Pier and Beam foundations are less susceptible to damage due to ground shifting.  If extreme ground shifting does occur, the foundation is easily adjusted, a process that is much less expensive than slab foundation repairs.  Pier and Beam foundations are a system of reinforced-concrete pad footings or continuous, reinforced-concrete spread footings and beams that support a structure above grade.

Description:  Soil properties and qualities that affect installation and maintenance of Pier and Beam foundations are those that influence the ease of excavation, grading, flooding, and stability.  The properties and qualities that affect the ease of excavation and grading are depth and hardness and depth of bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, flooding, the amount of large stones, and slope.  The properties that affect the soils ability to support the structure are soil strength as inferred from the AASHTO group index, shrink-swell behavior, subsidence, and depth to the seasonal high water table.  The properties that affect maintenance or durability are shrink-swell, pH, and subsidence.

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS  Subsurface Water Management, System Performance"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for systems that involve performance and functionality of underground drainage systems. These systems are designed to remove excess subsurface water from the soil and reduce soil saturation. The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.
 
The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition). If a soil's property within 150 cm (59 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less than the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support 
the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications. 

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation> 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).
 

 
Scope: The soil interpretation for ""WMS - Subsurface Water Management, System Performance"" is designed to be used as a tool in evaluating and identifying soil limitations for performance of subsurface drainage systems that involve functionality of underground drainage pipe, tile, or tubing. As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its undisturbed condition and does not consider present land use. The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties on performance of Subsurface Water Management structures. 
 
Description: Subsurface drainage is the process of removing excess subsurface water from agricultural land. How easily and effectively a subsurface water management structure can performed depend on the depth to dense layer, slow percolation, soil reaction, excess salts, excess sodium, subsidence, excess gypsum, sedimentation, water table depth, and flooding. 

         Criteria: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.
  A. A water table must be present. Monthly recorded water table within 125 cm (4 ft) from surface must occur in one or more months or else ""drainage normally not required. 

          AND

B. Performance and Functionality 

1. Dense layer:  This subrule deals with the relationship between soil bulk density and water movement.  As bulk density increases, water movement is incrementally limited and percolatio reduced.  At some point, water can no longer penetrate the soil and the bulk density becomes not just a limitor, but a restriction.  Bulk density is related to the texture of the soil, with sandy textured soils typically being denser than silty or clayey soils.  Silty soils are non-limiting over a wider range of bulk density than sandy or clayey soils.  Bulk density, therefore, is expressed as a ratio of the difference of the existing bulk density minus an optimal bulk density for each sand, silt, and clay combination divided by the theoretical difference between the water restricting bulk density minus the optimal bulk density at each combination of sand silt and clay.

Property used:  BULK DENSITY RATIO MAXIMUM 150CM OR RESTRICTION, Modality representative value


Restrictive Limits:

Null bulk density is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

     OR 

2. PERCS SLOWLY: Soils with low hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) have slow percolation causing excess runoff   and erosion during high precipitation or irrigation events.

     NULL data are assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

        (Maximum Duration)"" (Modality - representative value)

Null EC is assigned to the ""not rated"" class. 

OR 

7. Excess Sodium: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio may disperse, limiting the flow of water to the tile, and suppress plant growth and will require a high degree of management.

 Null SAR is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

OR

8. SUBSIDENCE: NSSH 618.59, B, 1-3. The susceptibility of soils to subsidence is an important consideration for organic soils that are drained. If these soils are drained for community development, special foundations are needed for buildings. Utility lines, sidewalks, and roads that lack special foundations may settle at different rates, thus causing breakage, high maintenance costs, and inconvenience. If the soils are drained for farming, the long-term effects of subsidence, the possible destruction of land if it subsides below the water table must be considered. Subsidence as a result of drainage is attributed to the following factors. The first three factors are responsible for the initial subsidence that occurs rapidly, specifically within about 3 years after the water table is lowered.
     	-Shrinkage from drying,
     	-Consolidation due to loss of ground-water buoyancy,
     	-Compaction from tillage or manipulation,
    	 -Wind erosion,
     	-Burning,
     	-Biochemical oxidation.
After the initial subsidence, a degree of stability is reached and the loss of elevation declines to a steady rate, primarily because of oxidation. The oxidation and subsidence continue at this slower rate until stopped by the water table or underlying mineral material. The rate of subsidence depends on
     	-Ground-water depth,
    	 -Amount of organic matter,
     	-Kind of organic matter,
     	-Soil temperature,
     	-pH,
     	-Biochemical activity.
Soil feature considered is total subsidence.

Property used: SUBSIDENCE TOTAL,  Modality: Representative Value
Restrictive limits:

OR

9. EXCESS GYPSUM: Excess gypsum may dissolve into water flowing through the subsurface drain and cause subsidence or piping of the drain. It may also contaminate subsurface water at the discharge of the drain. Soil feature considered is the maximum gypsum percent between 0 and 150 cm or a restrictive layer.

Property used: GYPSUM MAXIMUM 0-150CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION,   Modality: Representative Value
    	 Restrictive limits:
          Very limited               >= 40%
          Somewhat limited     > 5 to < 40%
          Not limited          <= 5%
     	NULL data are assigned to the ""not limited"" class.

OR

10. SEDIMENTATION: Sedimentation is the tendency for particles in suspension to settle out of the fluid in which they are entrained, and come to rest against a barrier. This is due to their motion through the fluid in response to the forces acting on them: these forces can be due to gravity, centrifugal acceleration or electromagnetism. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation) There is typically not enough energy in the system to transport particles larger than fine sand in suspension. As energy (flow) rates vary the fine sand and very fine sand fractions settle out first when energy is reduced while the smaller particle fractions tend to stay in suspension longer and be transported further. The accumulation of the fine sand and very fine sand fraction may reduce tile drain capacity and potentially compromise the performance of tile drains. The soil feature considered is the maximum amount of fine sand plus very fine sand in horizons that have less than 12 percent total clay in the depth range 60 to 125 cm.

Property used: USDA TEXTURE FS+VFS WHEN <12% C, MAX IN DEPTH 60-125CM,   Modality: Representative Value
Restrictive limits:
          Very limited                >= 50%
          Somewhat limited      > 20 and < 50%
          Not limited                 <=20%
     NULL fine and very fine sand data are assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

 AND

Restrictive limits:

          Rated                              <= 125 cm
          Drainage not needed      > 125 cm
     NULL data are assigned ""Drainage not needed"" class.

Note

The original national ""Tile Drains and Underground Outlet"" interpretation was published in Part 
620, Soil Interpretation Rating Guides, of the National Soil Survey Handbook (1993 version). The 
national interpretation was dropped in the late 1990s. The original interpretation rules and 
criteria were modified and adapted to reflect Texas needs and converted to a state soil 
interpretation, ""WMS Tile Drains and Underground Outlets."" This interpretation was subjected to 
national review and is proposed for reestablishment as a National Soil Interpretation, ""WMS  
Subsurface Water Management, System Installation"|07/19/2018 19:46:25|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666550"

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS - Water Management System, Outflow Quality"" evaluate a soil's limitations for outflow quality from conservation systems that involve the movement or conveyance of surface water across the landscape and excess subsurface water from the soil. Such conveyances are graded ditches, grassed waterways, terraces, diversions, tile drains and underground outlets etc. The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use. 

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limited condition) and 1.0 (limited condition). If a soil property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less than the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.  Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation= 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0). or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

The Micro-irrigation, Subsurface Drip was developed by the Temple, Texas interpretation and irrigation engineering staffs and is NOT DESIGNED NOR INTENDED TO BE USED IN A REGULATORY MANNER.  The original interpretation rules and criteria developed by Temple, Texas for Micro-irrigation, Subsurface Drip had been modified to meet states needs for this application in other regions of the United States. The soil properties and qualities that affect design, layout, construction, management, or performance of the irrigation system are evaluated and their degree of limitation determines the final rating.

Scope: Micro- irrigation systems are irrigation systems that apply low volume water application on or below the soil surface: as drops, tiny streams or miniature spray through emitters or applicators placed along a water delivery line. This report addresses Subsurface Drip Irrigation (SDI) systems which are buried micro-irrigation systems that apply water directly to the subsoil very slowly.  Generally, these systems are very efficient irrigation technologies in terms of both water and energy use and are suitable for used in windbreaks, vegetables, berries, landscape plantings, vineyards, orchards, and some row crops.   The Micro- irrigation (Above Ground) report addresses those systems which emit or apply water at or on the soil surface.

Description: The soil properties and qualities that affect design, layout, construction, management, or performance of the irrigation system are evaluated and their degree of limitation determines the final rating.  The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of drip irrigation systems are soil depth, available water capacity, wetness, or ponding, a need for drainage, percolation rate, pH, erosion potential, and flooding.  The soil properties and qualities that influence installation are soil depth, stoniness, flooding, and ponding.  The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are available water capacity, shrink-swell, salts, lime, pH and sodium.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1.  Calcium Carbonate: Soils with free carbonates below the surface layer may reduce irrigation efficiency and effectiveness by increasing irrigation intake rate from what would have been estimated based on texture alone. Calcium Carbonate may restrict intake if compacted or equipment blockages from precipitation of calcium.  Free carbonates can also restrict available root zone of irrigated crops.   Soil feature considered is the maximum CaCO3 equivalent (pct in thickest layer) between 25 and 100cm (10 to 40 inches) or a restrictive layer.

	Property used: WMS - CaCO3 MAXIMUM 25-100CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Somewhat limiting	 => 50%
			Not limiting		   < 50%
	Null CaCO3 is assigned to the Not limiting class.

2.  Depth to hard bedrock: Shallow depth to hard bedrock can impede installation of irrigation system pipelines, appurtenances, and subsurface drip irrigation laterals.   A shallow depth to hard bedrock reduce available rooting depth, and available water capacity making it unlikely that anticipated crop response to microirrigation will be achieved.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

Shallow depth to bedrock also limits the soil's adsorptive capacity and the thickness of the biologically active zone through with waste materials can percolate.  Shallow soils may pose environmental and health risks when agricultural and municipal waste materials are applied. 

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO BEDROCK (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		  < 50 cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 50 cm and <100 cm
			Not limiting		=> 100 cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF BEDROCK RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		 = ""bedrock (lithic)""
			Not limiting not	 = ""bedrock (lithic)""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

3.  Depth to soft bedrock: Shallow depth to soft bedrock can impede installation of irrigation system pipelines, appurtenances, and subsurface drip irrigation laterals.   A shallow depth to soft bedrock reduce available rooting depth, and available water capacity making it unlikely that anticipated crop response to microirrigation will be achieved.    Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the
restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO BEDROCK (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		 =< 50cm
			Somewhat limiting	   > 50cm and < 100cm
			Not limiting		 => 100cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF BEDROCK RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	 = ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)""
			Not limiting 	not = ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

4.  Depth to cemented pan: Shallow depth to cemented pan can impede installation of subsurface drip irrigation laterals, and could result in irrigation laterals being placed below the pan making uniform soil moisture distribution problematic.  A shallow depth to cemented pan could also reduce rooting depth and available water capacity, making it unlikely that anticipated crop response to microirrigation will be achieved.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 50cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 50 and < 100cm
			Not limiting		=> 100cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	  = ""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or ""petrogypsic"" 
			Not limiting	  not = ""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or petrogypsic"" 
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE HARDNESS (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		not = ""Noncemented""
			Not limiting		      = ""Noncemented""
	Null hardness is assigned to the limiting class.

5.  Depth to saturated zone: A shallow depth to water table will hamper installation of irrigation pipelines, SDI lateral tubing, appurtenances, and earth forming that might be needed install and maintain an irrigation system.  A shallow depth to water table will also complicate the irrigation water management requirements for the site, and often increases probability of salinity problems developing.  A shallow water table will also make the soil difficult to work, restrict rooting zone, and increase risk of ground water contamination through leaching of irrigation chemical treatment constituents, nitrates, pesticides or other contaminants.  These areas are slow to drain and can become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month in the growing season. Used 90 cm as limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1. 

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM DURING GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 60cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 60 to < 90cm
			Not limiting		=> 90cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

6.  Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio are prone to develop irrigation water and rainfall infiltration restriction/reductions due to soil dispersion caused by sodium in the soil and/or soil water.  Soils with elevated SARs will require monitoring of SAR in soil and irrigation water being applied, very careful irrigation water management, possible chemical treatment.  An elevated SAR may impact expected crop response to irrigation by suppressing plant growth and will require a high degree of management.  Soil feature considered is the highest sodium adsorption ratio for horizons that have any portion in the depth range 0 to 100cm.

	Property used: WMS - SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-100cm (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting		=> 20
			Somewhat limiting	  > 6 to < 20
			Not limiting		<= 6			
	Null SAR is assigned not rated.

7.  Flooding: Flooding: Flooding frequency greater then rare has the potential to damage irrigation infrastructure, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most microirrigation (Subsurface Drip) systems involve a relatively high capitol investment. Most producers will want to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install this type of  irrigation system will pay.  A frequently flooded area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Frequently flooded areas are more likely to transport nutrients, and agricultural and water treatment chemicals, which are typically applied through or in conjunction with this type of irrigation system.    Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

	Property used: WMS - FLOODING FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest (PAN) (Maximum Duration) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		= Very frequent""
			Somewhat limiting	= ""occasional"" or frequent
			Not limiting		= ""none"" or ""very rare"" or ""rare""
	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.

8.  Content of large stones (a): Large stone impede installation of irrigation system mains, subsurface drip laterals, and appurtenances.  Large stones have the potential to damage SDI tubing over time when tubing is installed in contact with stones.  Large stones may make operation and management on buried microirrigation tubing more difficult and may impact expected crop response to irrigation by effecting tillage, planting, and harvesting and plant growth through reduced soil available water content.    Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in the horizons above a restrictive feature or from 0 to 100 cm deep.

	Property used: WMS - FRAGMENTS > 75MM WEIGHTED AVE. IN DEPTH 0-100CM (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=> 25%
			Somewhat limiting	  > 0% and < 25%
			Not limiting		= 0%
	Null fragment data are assigned Not rated.

9.  Content of large stones (b): Excessive stones (rock fragments, > 10 inch in diameter) on the soil surface layer may impede installation of subsurface irrigation systems and mechanized equipment operations.  Soil feature considered is percent rock fragments > 10 inches in size on the surface soil layer.

	Property used: WMS - FRAGMENTS >=250MM ON THE SURFACE (PAN) Modality - high, low, and representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=> 5%
			Somewhat limiting	  > 0.1 to < 5%
			Not limiting		<= 0.1%
	Null > 10 inch rock fragment data are assigned to the Not limiting class.

10. Low Available Water Capacity:  Soils with low available water capacities have limited potential to hold irrigation water.  Irrigation management is critical on soil with low AWC to insure adequate soil water for maximum plant growth and production.  Soil feature considered is the (available water capacity x layer thickness) summed through a depth of 100cm or to a restrictive layer. Used 0.05 cm/cm as limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.

	Property used: WMS - AVAILABLE WATER CAPACITY IN DEPTH 0-100cm (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 5cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 5 cm and < 12 cm
			Not limiting		=> 12 cm 
	Null AWC is assigned to the Not rated class.

11. Ponding:  Ponding restricts or effects tillage, rooting depth, and plant growth.    Ponding may damage irrigation infrastructure, and will likely impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most irrigation systems involve a relatively high investment in money or labor or both. Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install an irrigation system will pay.  A ponding area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Soil feature considered is ponding any month during growing season. 
	
	Property used: WMS - PONDING DURATION GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		 = long"" or ""very long""
			Somewhat limiting	 = brief or ""very brief""
			Not limiting		 = ""none""
	Null ponding duration is assigned to the Not limiting class.

12. Excess salt: Soils with high electrical conductivity may suppress plant growth and will require a high degree of management.  Soils with elevated salinity levels will require EC monitoring of soil and irrigation water being applied.  Matching irrigated crop selection to expected salinity levels, proper leaching, and careful irrigation water management, will be required on soils with elevated salinity. A properly designed drainage system may be required to properly irrigate some soils with elevated salinity levels.  Irrigation runoff and associated subsurface drainage from these soils has potential to increase salinity levels in groundwater, downstream surface waters, and wetlands.  Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest electrical conductivity 0-100 cm.
Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest electrical conductivity.

	Property used: WMS - SALINITY MAXIMUM (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Somewhat limiting	=> 4
			Not limiting		  < 4
	Null EC is assigned not rated.

13. Seepage: Microirrigation Subsurface Irrigation Systems utilize irrigation laterals installed below the normal tillage zone to prevent damage.  Especially in drier climates rapid permeability can result in crop germination problems if applied irrigation water is unable to move up to planted seeds to insure germination.  In addition, rapid permeability that allows irrigation water to percolate out of the root zone is undesirable and increases irrigation management expenses.  Permeability that maintains irrigation water within the root zone during the consumptive use period is desirable to maintain the growth and vigor of the irrigated crop. Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest Ksat that has any portion in the depth range 0 to 100 cm or to a restrictive layer if less then 100 cm.

	Property used: WMS - KSAT MAXIMUM, 0-100CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting		  > 44.0 um/sec
			Somewhat limiting	  > 21.2 to < 44.0 um/sec 
			Not limiting		<= 21.2 um/sec
	Null Ksat is assigned not rated.

14. Shrink-Swell: High shrink-swell potential limits the installation and maintenance of subsurface drip irrigation lines and emitters.  Subsurface Drip Irrigation (SDI) tubing can be damaged due to stress imposed by movement of high shrink swell clays.  Damage to buried lateral lines and resulting sediment contamination from field repairs can be significant problems on high shrink swell soils tubing is exposed by cracks allowing easy rodent access.   In some cases this limitation can be addressed by operating and managing a microirrigation (subsurface drip irrigation) system to maintain soil moisture year round at a level that will prevent soil cracking.  In drier climates and limited water supply areas this may not be an option.  Soil feature considered is the maximum linear extensibility percent

	Property used: WMS - SHRINK-SWELL, MAXIMUM 0-100CM (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=> 10.5
			Somewhat limiting	  > 4.5 to < 10.5
			Not limiting		=< 4.5
	Null shrink-swell is assigned to the Not rated class.

15. Soil Reaction (too acid or alkaline): Low or high soil pH can result in corrosion of irrigation infrastructure, significantly increase in irrigation system operation and maintenance requirements, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by restricting plant growth.   Soil feature considered is the (pH) in 0-100 cm. 
	
	Property used: WMS - SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MINIMUM, 0 TO 100CM (PAN) AND SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MAXIMUM, 0 TO 100CM (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
	
	Restriction limits:  Too acid
			Very limiting		=< 3.5
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 3.5 and <5.0
			Not limiting		=> 5.0
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

		Restriction limits:  Too alkaline
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 9.0 
			Not limiting		=< 9.0
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

16. Subsidence: The presence of gypsum or soluble salts in the soil, parent material, or bedrock may lead to the formation of subsidence features if the amount of irrigation water applied grossly exceeds evapotranspiration.  In humid climates, excessive irrigation on soils occuring over limestone bedrock can also experience sinkhole formation.  Soil features considered are the gypsum content of the soil and bedrock as well as the presence of limestone bedrock.


	Property used: ""LIMESTONE RESIDUUM TEST""  (Modality - and representative value)
	
	
		 Restrictive Limits:
		    Limiting		If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
		    Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    
		    
		  NOTE!!!  As the property is now written, if bedrock is not populated, a N0 is returned.
		  NOTE!!!  This base rule will be expanded to evaluate more types of bedrock.
		  
		  
	Property used: ""PARENT MATERIAL ORIGIN IS SOLUBLE SALT""  (Modality - and representative value)
	
			Limiting	If the bedrock is soluble salt, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
		    	Not limiting	If the bedrock is not soluble salt, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    
		  
		  
	Property used:  ""SUBSIDENCE DUE TO GYPSUM, REV""  (Modality - and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

			Somewhat limiting	10-30cm
			Not limiting		<= 10cm

"TX201"|"Ground-based Solar Arrays, Soil-penetrating Anchor Systems"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Ground-based solar arrays are sets of photovoltaic panels that are not situated on a building or pole.  These installations consist of a racking system that holds the panel in the desired orientation and the foundation structures that hold the racking system to the ground.  Two basic methods are used to hold the systems to the ground, based on site conditions and cost.  One method employs driven piles, screw augers, or concrete piers that penetrate into the soil to provide a stable foundation. The ease of installation and general site suitability of soil-penetrating anchoring systems depends on soil characteristics such as rock fragment content, soil depth, soil strength, soil corrosivity, shrink-swell tendencies, and drainage.  The other basic anchoring system utilizes precast ballasted footings or ballasted trays on the soil surface to make the arrays too heavy to move.  The site considerations that impact both basic systems are slope, slope aspect, wind speed, land surface shape, flooding, and ponding.  Other factors that will contribute to the function of a solar power array include daily hours of sunlight and shading from hills, trees or buildings.

Soil-penetrating anchoring systems can be used where the soil conditions are suitable.  Installation of these systems requires some power equipment for hauling components and either driving piles, turning helices, or boring holes to install the anchoring apparatus.  


Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Ground-based Solar Panel Arrays"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Ground-based Solar Panel Array"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

		Not limiting         not = ""pf""
		
	Null USDA Texture Modifier are assigned to the Not limiting class.

2. Depth to hard bedrock: Shallow depth to hard bedrock restricts the depth of penetration and limits site preparation such as shaping and leveling. Soil feature 
considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the 
depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK HARD (Modality - representative value)
		
	Restrictive limits:

		Somewhat limiting	> 100 to < 150cm
		Not limiting	        => 150cm

	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	                not = noncemented
		Not limiting	= noncemented
				
	Null hardness is assigned to the Not limiting class.

4. Content of large stones: Large stone impede the workability of the soil and restrict trafficability of heavy machinery and site reclamation. Stones and cobbles may prohibit penetration by helical anchors or driven piles.  Even at lower rock fragment content, the fragments may scratch off protective coatings on steel anchor devices.  Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in the horizons above a restrictive feature or from 0 to 100 cm deep.

	Property used: FRAGMENTS > 75MM WEIGHTED AVE. IN DEPTH 0-100CM (Modality - high, low, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		> 50%
		Somewhat limiting	>= 25% to <= 50%
		Not limiting		< 25%
		
	Null fragment data are assigned Not rated.

5. Ponding: Ponding is the condition where standing water is on the soil surface for a given period of time.  Soils that pond have restrictions that limit the installation and function of most land use applications.  Soil features considered are ponding duration and frequency classes for all months.

	Property used: PONDING DURATION (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		= ""very brief"" or ""brief"" or ""long"" or ""very long""
		Not limiting	not = ""very brief"" or ""brief"" or ""long"" or ""very long""
		
	Null duration is assigned to the Not limiting class.
OR
		
	Property used: PONDING FREQUENCY

	Restrictive limits:
		Not limiting	    = ""none""
		Limiting	                    not = ""none""
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class. 


 
6.  Slope: Steep slopes impede trafficability of heavy machinery and reclamation of borrow sites. Some slope may be beneficial to the solar panel array because the rows could be closer together if the slope aspect is to the south.  Areas that are too steep make installation more difficult and are harder to maintain.  Soil feature considered is the component slope.
		
	Property used: SLOPE (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		> 15%
		Somewhat limiting	>= 8 and <= 15%
		Not limiting		< 8%			
		
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.

7.  Depth to saturated zone: Soils with shallow depth to a water table may become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation and are slow to drain.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month.

	Property used: HIGH WATER TABLE DEPTH MINIMUM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=< 30cm
		Somewhat limiting	 > 30 to < 75cm
		Not limiting		=> 75cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.


8.  Steel corrosion:  Under certain soil conditions, electromotive cells can be set up that cause unciated steel to react with the surrounding soil.  Anything that can cause a potential difference can cause accelerated corrosion, but the main variables are soil resistivity, pH, sulfates, and watertables.  Special attention must be given to those soil properties that affect the access of oxygen and moisture to the metal, the electrolyte, the chemical reaction in the electrolyte, and the flow of current through the electrolyte. Special attention must be given to the presence of sulfides or of minerals, such as pyrite, that can be weathered readily and thus cause a high degree of corrosion in metals.  The possibility of corrosion is greater for extensive installations that intersect soil boundaries or soil horizons than for installations that are in one kind of soil or in one soil horizon.

        Property used: COMPONENT STEEL CORROSION (Modality - representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		= ""high""
		Somewhat limiting	= ""moderate""
		Not limiting	= ""low""			
		
	Null corrosion is assigned Not rated.

9. Shrink-swell:  Excessive shrink-swell in the depth between 25 and 100cm deep can cause structure foundations to shift and stresses to be placed on the solar panel racks.  The soil feature considered is weighted average of percent linear extensibility of the horizons between a depth of 10 to 40 inches or above bedrock.

	Property used: SHRINK-SWELL THICKEST LAYER 25-100cm OR ABOVE ROCK (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
			
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 > 6%
		Somewhat limiting	=> 3% to <= 6%
		Not limiting	 < 3%
		
	Null linear extensibility is assigned to the Not limiting class.


10.  Frost action: Frost heaving can cause piles to shift and stresses to build up in the superstructure.  Soil feature considered is frost action.
	
	Property used: POTENTIAL FROST ACTION (Modality - representative value)

Ground-based solar arrays are sets of photovoltaic panels that are not situated on a building or pole.  These installations consist of a racking system that holds the panel in the desired orientation and the foundation structures that hold the racking system to the ground.  Two basic methods are used to hold the systems to the ground, based on site conditions and cost.  One method employs driven piles, screw augers, or concrete piers that penetrate into the soil to provide a stable foundation. The ease of installation and general site suitability of soil-penetrating anchoring systems depends on soil characteristics such as rock fragment content, soil depth, soil strength, soil corrosivity, shrink-swell tendencies, and drainage.  The other basic anchoring system utilizes precast ballasted footings or ballasted trays on the soil surface to make the arrays too heavy to move.  The site considerations that impact both basic systems are slope, slope aspect, wind speed, land surface shape, flooding, and ponding.  Other factors that will contribute to the function of a solar power array include daily hours of sunlight and shading from hills, trees, or buildings.

Ballast anchor systems can be used in some places where soil-penetrating systems cannot, such as in shallow or stony soil.  Also, since they do not penetrate the soil, ballast systems can be used where the soil is contaminated and disturbance is to be avoided.  The soil in the area must have sufficient strength to be able to support the vehicles that haul the ballast and the machinery to install it.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Ground-based Solar Panel Arrays"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Ground-based Solar Panel Arrays"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Catastrophic Event, Large Animal Mortality, Burial"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (~79 inches) of the soil surface has a membership index greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership index for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Catastrophic Event, Large Animal Mortality, Burial"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are Not limited (rating index = 0), Slightly limited (rating index >0 and <.30), Somewhat limited (>.30 and <.80), Severely limited (>.80 and <0.99), Very severely limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Catastrophic Event, Large Animal Mortality, Burial is a method of disposing of deceased animals as a result of a large scale natural disaster such as a hurricane.  The animals are disposed of by placing the carcasses in successive layers in an excavated and sloped pit.  The carcasses are spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the pit.  When the pit is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the burial pit.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

The estimated land area needed to dispose of mature cattle ranges from 1.2 (McDaniel, 1991) to 3.5 (Ollis, 2002) cubic yards.  A single adult bovine is considered equivalent to 5 sheep or 5 hogs (McDaniel, 1991; USDA, 1980).  Lund et al estimate that about 92,000 cubic yards of volume would be needed to dispose of 30,000 head of cattle, assuming a trench depth of 8.5 feet (which is somewhat below the depth of observation for typical soil survey).  This is about seven acres.  Leachate collection should be considered because the putrefaction of one adult bovine is estimated to release 21 gallons of fluid in the first week and a total of about 42 gallons in the first month (Munroe, 2001).  Collection of gases released during the decomposition process should also be considered. 

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  However, because pits may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the pit developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the pit.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing pits for which the pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a Large Animal Disposal, Burial operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled pit area.

Criteria used:

1.  Adsorption:  Soils having a low cec or ecec may not attenuate biohazardous material from the decay process.  It is assumed that the upper 25 cm of the site will be stockpiled for use in revegetating the site.  It is also assumed that alternating layers of soil and biological materials will be placed in the excavation.

Soils having low CEC or ECEC are not able to retain some leachates.  A soil is a full member of the set of soils having low adsorption if the CEC or ECEC to clay ratio is below 0.05, a partial member between 0.05 and 0.15, and a nonmember if the cec or ecec to clay ratio is over 0.150.

9.  Ponding: Ponding is the condition where standing water is on the soil surface for a given period of time.  Soil that pond have restrictions that limit the installation and function of most land use applications.  Soil features considered are ponding duration and frequency classes for all months.

10.  Rock Outcrop:  Areas that have rock outcrop in the vicinity are not likely to have a sufficiently large area of soil for the facility.  Rock outcrops can interfere with renovation of the leachate from the facility.
        
        Property used: PA ROCK OUTCROP 2(Modality - representative value)

		Not limiting		The phase ""rock outcrop"" does not occur in the map unit name.
				
Any soil with a portion or full map unit name of Rock Outcrop is returned as a value of 1 and is given the rating of Rock Outcrop and is considered a limitation.

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""rocky"" is returned as a value of .3 and is given the rating of ""Slight Rock Outcrop"".

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""very rocky"" is returned as a value of .7 and is given the rating of ""Severe Rock Outcrop"".

All map units have a name, no null data should be encountered.
	
11.  Seepage:  The soil's bottom layer Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids through the soil and underlying materials is unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the Ksat of the bottom layer or the layer immediately above bedrock.  In areas where seepage is somewhat limiting, a clay liner may be used to lower the transmission rate of the bottom of the pit.  This condition is not restrictive for soil in subgroups that occur Aridic moisture regimes, great groups that contain torri, or soils orders that are aridisols.

		Not limiting	  < 14.0 micrometers/sec
		
	Null Ksat values are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
6/15/04 PRF modified the hedge from ""NULL NOT RATED"" to ""NOT NULL AND"".  The Null values were throwing out a ""Not Rated"" that affected the final rating.

12.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's adsorptive capacity and the thickness of the biologically active zone through with waste materials can percolate.  Shallow soils may pose environmental and health risks when agricultural and municipal waste materials are applied. These soils may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when trench landfills are installed. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"" or ""bedrock (paralithic) AND restriction hardness IS NOT extremely weakly, very weakly, or weakly cemented. Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

	Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK LITHIC/PARALITHIC (HARDNESS)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Severely Limiting		 < 150cm
                                Somewhat Limiting                   150 - 199 cm
		Not limiting		=> 200cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
13.  Slope: Steep slopes impede trafficability of heavy machinery and reclamation of borrow sites.  Soil feature considered is the component slope.
		
	Property used: Slope 5 to 12%
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		> 12%
		Somewhat limiting	>= 5 and <= 12%
		Not limiting		< 5%			
		
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.
	
14.  Water Gathering Surface: Some surfaces are shaped so as to gather water.  This additional water may cause problems for land use.  Soils that are concave up and down their slope and concave across their slope are most strongly water gathering.  Soils that are concave across their slope and linear or convex up and down their slopes are less water collecting.  Soils that are linear across their slopes and concave up and down their slopes are somewhat water collecting.  Soils that are convex up and down their slopes and convex across their slopes are the least water gathering.

Water gathering (concave) surfaces can concentrate water flow and cause accelerated erosion.  Increased costs because of materials and land shaping may be needed to prevent erosion. Wet moisture classes that have water gathering surfaces are more restrictive than drier moisture classes that have water gathering surfaces. 
		  
		  Property Used: WATER GATHERING SURFACE

		    Slightly limiting		Concave across, linear or convex up-down
		    Not limiting		All other surface shapes
		    
		  NOTE!!!  The fuzzy number returned by this rule can not exceed 0.5.
		  
Null slope shape is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

15. Subaerial Component: Soil components can be on land and also submerged in water less than 2 meters deep. These submerged soil components are referred to as subaqueous. Animal Burial should be conducted on land and not in subaqueous soils. Therefore, any soil components occurring in a subaqeous state should be excluded from consideration for large animal disposal by burial. 
		Property Used:  DRAINAGE CLASS IS NOT SUBAQUEOUS

	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting 		if the component has a subaqeous drainage class populated
Not limiting	if the component has a drainage class that is null or is populated with any drainage class other than subaqeous

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Catastrophic Event, Large Animal Disposal, Incinerate"".  This interpretation is meant to provide another option for carcass disposal following a catastrophic event.   If a soil's property within 91 cm (36 inches) of the soil surface has a membership index greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership index for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Catastrophic Event Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Incinerate"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are Not limited (rating index = 0), Slightly limited (rating index >0 and <.30), Somewhat limited (>.30 and <.80), Severely limited (>.80 and <0.99), Very severely limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Catastrophic Event, Large Animal Disposal, Incinerate is a method of disposing dead animals by placing the carcasses in an shallow excavated pit 91 cm (~36 inches) deep or less. The carcasses are spread, compacted, and burned using established industry incineration techniques. Once carcasses have been sufficiently incinerated, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the burial pit.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

The estimated land area needed to dispose of mature cattle ranges from 1.2 (McDaniel, 1991) to 3.5 (Ollis, 2002) cubic yards.  A single adult bovine is considered equivalent to 5 sheep or 5 hogs (McDaniel, 1991; USDA, 1980).  Lund et al estimate that about 92,000 cubic yards of volume would be needed to dispose of 30,000 head of cattle, assuming a trench depth of 8.5 feet (which is somewhat below the depth of observation for typical soil survey).  This is about seven acres.  Leachate collection should be considered because the putrefaction of one adult bovine is estimated to release 21 gallons of fluid in the first week and a total of about 42 gallons in the first month (Munroe, 2001).  Collection of gases released during the decomposition process should also be considered. 

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  However, because pits may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the pit developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential contamination of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of contamination, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the pit.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing pits for which the pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a Large Animal Disposal, Burial operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled pit area.

Criteria used:

1.  Adsorption:  Soils having a low cec or ecec may not attenuate biohazardous material from the decay process.  It is assumed that the upper 25 cm of the site will be stockpiled for use in revegetating the site.  It is also assumed that alternating layers of soil and biological materials will be placed in the excavation.

Soils having low CEC or ECEC are not able to retain some leachates.  A soil is a full member of the set of soils having low adsorption if the CEC or ECEC to clay ratio is below 0.05, a partial member between 0.05 and 0.15, and a nonmember if the cec or ecec to clay ratio is over 0.150.

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""very rocky"" is returned as a value of .7 and is given the rating of ""Severe Rock Outcrop"".

All map units have a name, no null data should be encountered.

11.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's adsorptive capacity and the thickness of the biologically active zone through with waste materials can percolate.  Shallow soils may pose environmental and health risks when agricultural and municipal waste materials are applied.

Soils that are linear across their slopes and concave up and down their slopes are somewhat water collecting.  Soils that are convex up and down their slopes and convex across their slopes are the least water gathering.

Water gathering (concave) surfaces can concentrate water flow and cause accelerated erosion.  Increased costs because of materials and land shaping may be needed to prevent erosion.

Summary:

Soils can be rated based on their susceptibility to degradation in the Fragile Soil Index interpretation.  Fragile soils are those that are most vulnerable to degradation. They are easily degraded (have low resistance) and are highly susceptible to erosion with low resilience. They are characterized as having low organic matter contents, low water-stable aggregates and low soil structure. Fragile soils are generally located on sloping ground, have sparse plant cover, and tend to be in arid and semiarid regions. A fragile soil index interpretation was developed to rate soils based on their fragility. The index can be used in conservation and watershed planning to assist in identifying soils and areas with greater vulnerability to degradation.

Soils are placed into interpretive classes based on their index rating.  Interpretative classes are not fragile (index rating <= 0.009), slightly fragile (index rating > 0.009 and <= 0.209), moderately fragile (rating index > 0.209 and <= 0.409), fragile (rating index > 0.409 and <= 0.609), highly fragile (rating index > 0.609 and <= 0.809), or extremely fragile (rating index > 0.809 and <= 1.0).

Description:

Soil fragility defines how vulnerable a soil is to degradation processes. When used in soil survey the index assesses the inherent soil condition. Depending on a soils inherent characteristics and the climate, soils can vary from highly resistant, or stable, to those that are vulnerable and extremely sensitive to degradation. A soils fragility can change over time do to climate change and changes in site characteristics, and thus fragility will change. Under stress, fragile soils can degrade to a new altered state which may be less or unfavorable to plant growth and less capable of performing soil functions. To assess the fragility of the soil, vulnerability indicators to degradation processes (mostly erosion) are used. The minimum dataset of indicators of soil fragility are as follows:

Organic matter content - The greater the organic matter content, the less fragile the soil. The organic matter content indicates the capacity of the soil to resist and/or recover from degradation. Increases in organic matter can improve the soil pore structure, increase water infiltration, reduce soil compaction, and decrease runoff and soil erosion. Decreasing organic matter contents indicate there has been a reduction in the capacity of the soil to function.

Soil aggregation/structure characteristics - The greater the stability of aggregates or improvement in soil structure, the less fragile the soil. Aggregate stability/soil structure indicates the capacity of the soil to resist degradation from accelerated water erosion (by increasing the amount of infiltration). From a biological point of view it is the pore structure that is important because that is where life finds its habitat (Wall, 2005). Decreasing stability of aggregates and destruction of soil structure implies an increase in soil degradation.

Rooting/soil depth - The greater the rooting depth, the less fragile the soil. Shallow soils are more vulnerable to degradation because they have limited rooting depth and have a reduced capacity to generate new soil. Soil depth is important for productivity. As erosion removes the upper soil profile, productivity will decline if the subsoil is limiting for crop growth. If erosion processes continue, there will eventually be no soil.

Vegetation coverage - The greater the vegetation coverage, the less fragile the soil. Vegetation cover is the areal percentage of the soil surface that is covered with vegetation. It is the proportion of the soil surface that is obscured by above ground vegetation such as leaves, stems, and flowers. Uncovered soil is vulnerable to the processes of soil erosion, both by wind, water and gravity. Under a protective cover of vegetation, erosion goes on so slowly that it is seldom harmful and is associated with the natural environment (Bennett, 1951). 

Slope - The greater the slope, the more vulnerable the soil is to degradation (primarily from erosion). Slope is a measure of the steepness or the degree of inclination of a feature relative to the horizontal plane. The steeper the slope, the faster the runoff flow and the more force it will have to erode soil material.

Aridity - The greater the aridity, the more vulnerable the soil is to degradation (primarily from erosion). Aridity is defined by the shortage of moisture and is essentially a climatic phenomenon that is based on average climatic conditions over an area (Agnew and Anderson, 1992). Lack of water is a main factor limiting biological processes, and thus the capacity to recover from a disturbance (decreasing resilience with decreasing moisture). Land areas will differ in their susceptibility to degradation depending in part on their climate (Eswaran et al., 2001).

Fragile Soil Index

Response or scoring curves (Karlen and Stott, 1994) are developed for each indicator. Scoring curves standardize the relationship between an indicator and the vulnerability to degradation. They convert measured indicator data to relative values ranging from 0 to 1. The standardized scores are then weighted. Aridity is given three times the weight because of its importance. Without adequate water, soil health and vegetation are difficult to restore and biological processes cannot function. Vegetative cover is equally as important as slope with twice the weight. Without vegetative cover the soil is exposed to wind and rain energy and combined with steep slopes can be devastating (Pimentel, 2006). The weighted scores are then added together to form the Fragile Soil Index (FSI): 

FSI = (0.1 x OM) + (0.1 x AgS) + (0.1 x RD) + (0.2 x V) + (0.2 x S) + (0.3 x AI)

Where OM = organic matter content score, AgS = aggregate stability/soil structure score, RD = rooting depth score, V = vegetative cover score, S = slope score and AI = aridity index score. Index values range from 0 to 1 with one being the most fragile (or limiting). Interpretation ratings are produced for mapunit components and are generally aggregated to the mapunit. If organic matter, vegetative cover, slope, soil structure, or aridity index is not available (null), the mapunit component is not rated. Interpretation ratings (from 0 -1) and fragility classes are shown below:

Scope: National


Criteria:

1. Organic Matter: The organic matter content of the surface horizon ('A' or 'O' horizons) is used in the index.

Property used: ORGANIC MATTER IS SURFACE LAYER (Modality - representative value)

The scoring curve for soil organic matter content in the surface layer ('A' or 'O' horizon) is based on the curve developed by the Cornell soil health assessment (medium curve). This was chosen because of the high inherent organic matter contents of the northeast (based on climate and soils), and would provide the maximum potential for organic matter and soil health on agricultural soils (of that found within the US). The organic matter content ranges from 0 to 7% with a score of one as the most limiting with zero percent organic matter. Anything over 7% gets a score of zero. The scoring curve shape is sigmoid as follows:

          Organic Matter score = (a + cx + ex2)/(1 + bx + dx2 +fx3)
          a = 1.0002993; b = -0.14767395; c = -0.21024973; d = -0.0081101367; e = 0.009697; f = 0.0073572721; x = organic matter (%)

Organic matter (OM) limits:
          Extremely Low OM: < 1.3%
          Very Low OM: 1.3 to 2.6%
          Low OM: 2.6 to 3.9%
          Moderate OM: 3.9 to 5.2%
          High OM: 5.2 to 7.0%
          Very High OM: > 7%

Null organic matter is assigned a 'not rated' for the interpretation.

2. Surface Structure: Soil structure of the surface layer is used in the index.

Property used: STRUCTURE INDEX OF SURFACE (Modality - representative value)

The scoring curve is based on the structure classes developed by Bob Grossman. The type, grade and size of structural units are grouped into classes as defined in Table 3 of the morphology index (Seybold et al., 2004). Structure classes range from 1 to 5 with 5 being the best.

Structure                          Criteria
  Class	
    5          Strong granular, strong very fine through medium blocky and very fine prismatic; 
                surface 'O' horizons (structure is not applicable to organic layers); if soil structure is
                null and OM > 10%
    4          Moderate granular, moderate very fine and fine blocky; strong fine.
    3          Moderate medium blocky; very fine, fine and medium prismatic; strong very coarse
                and coarse blocky.
    2          Weak granular; moderate very coarse and coarse blocky; coarse and medium prismatic; 
                strong very coarse and coarse prismatic; weak platy; weak lenticular.
    1          All other soil structures (includes columnar, wedge, cloddy, massive, and single grain).
 
Scores are as follows:

	Structure Class score= 1 if structure class 1; 0.75 if structure class 2; 0.5 if structure class 3; 0.25 if structure class 4; 0 if structure class 5

Surface Structure limits:
          Poor structure: structure class = 1
          Weakly structured: structure class = 2
          Moderately structured: structure class = 3
          Well structured: structure class = 4
          Highly structure: structure class = 5
 
O horizons (and OM > 10 if structure is null) are assigned to the highly structured class.
Null surface structure is assigned a 'not rated' for the interpretation.

3. Rooting Depth: Depth of the soil (or 152 cm) or to a root restrictive layer, whichever is shallower is used in the index. 

Property used: DEPTH TO FIRST RESTRICTION OR 152cm (Modality - representative value)

The scoring curve for effective rooting depth is developed based a maximum depth of 152 cm as being the least vulnerable to soil erosion. Response of crop yield to erosion is generally convex (Bakker et al., 2004). As erosion continues and the soil gets shallower increasingly severe productivity losses occur under equal erosion rates. The curve is based on depth to a root restrictive layer or 152 cm, whichever is shallower. The following is the scoring curve:

          Rooting Depth Score = a + bx + cx1.5 + dx3 
          a = 1.0000338; b = -0.019773028; c = 0.0011661322; d = -5.1038528e-08; x = rooting depth (cm)

Rooting depth limits:
          Very shallow: < 25 cm 
          Shallow: 25-50 cm 
          Moderately deep: 50-100 cm 
          Deep: 100-150 cm 
          Very deep: >150 cm

Null or zero depth is assigned to the not limiting class (Very deep).

4. Vegetative cover (includes sufrace fragment cover): The earth-cover-kind 1 and 2 for a map unit component is used in the index. Surface fragment cover in the component surface fragment table is also used.  The two cover percents are added together for a total cover percentage.

Property used: LAND COVER (Modality - representative value). 

The scoring curve for vegetative cover is based on the percent cover assigned to each earth-cover-kind 1 and 2 (plus any surface fragment cover) for a component. Vegetative cover plus surface fragment cover can range from 0 to 100%. Percent cover for each earth-cover-kind in shown below:

        Earth Cover Kind	                    Veg. Cover (%)
Artificial Cover                                                   80
     Rural transportation                                     100

The scoring curve shape is sigmoid as follows: 

          Veg Cover Score = (a + cx + ex2)(1 + bx +dx2)
          a = 0.99966629; b = -0.018080619; c = -0.019063775; d = 0.00018014742; e = 0.000090710991; x = veg cover (%)

Vegetative cover limits:
          Low vegetative cover: < 30
          Moderate vegetative cover: 30 - 60%
          Moderately-high vegetative cover: 60 - 80%
          High vegetative cover: > 80%

Null vegetative cover is assigned a 'not rated' for the interpretation.

5. Slope: The slope percent for the component is used in the index.

Property used: SLOPE (Modality - representative value)

The scoring curve for slope was based on the study by Lui et al. (1994). They showed that for slopes between 9 and 50%, the soil loss was linearly related to the sine of the slope angle, similar to what is used in RULSE but takes into account steeper slopes. The shape of the curve in plot of slope percent versus soil loss normalized to 9% is slightly convex from 9 to 50% slopes. The Y axis (soil loss normalized to 9%) was replaced with 0 to 1 to produce the scoring curve. Below 9%, the shape is still convex but less steep.  The scoring curve is as follows:

	Slope score = (a + cx + ex2 + gx3)/(1 + bx + dx2 + fx3)
	a = -0.00097169878; b = -0.085569059; c = 0.022525266; d = 0.0068975356; e = -0.0036133219; f = 8.00000689E-05; g = 0.00024152235; x = slope gradient (%)

Slope limits:
          Very steep: > 45
          Steep: 28 - 45%
          Moderately steep: 16 - 28%
          Strongly sloping: 8 - 16%
          Gently sloping: 3 - 8%
          Nearly level: 0 - 3%

Null slope is assigned a 'not rated' for the interpretation.

6. Aridity: The De Martonne (1926) aridity index (Am) (as reviewed in Maliva and Missimer, 2012 and Lunga et al., 2011) uses temperature as a proxy for ETp as follows: Am = P/(T + 10) where, P (mm) is the annual precipitation and T (C) the mean annual temperature. The equation is appropriate for temperatures greater than -9.9C. The De Martonne aridity index decreases (approaches zero) with increasing aridity. 

Property used: ARIDITY INDEX (Modality - representative value)

 The shape of the scoring curve is sigmoid as follows:
	Aridity Index score = (a + cx + ex2)/(1 + bx + dx2)
	a = 0.99992575; b = -0.069544299; c = -0.065093715; d = 0.0019192058; e = 0.0010584767; x = aridity index

Aridity index limits (classification according to De Martonne, 1926):
          Very dry: 0 - 5
          Dry: 5 - 15
          Semi-dry: 15 - 20
          Mildly wet: 20 - 30
          Wet: 30 - 60
          Very wet: > 60

Aridity index values greater than 30 are considered not fragile.
Null aridity index is assigned a 'not rated' for the interpretation.

Surface sealing is the orientation and packing of dispersed soil particles that result from the physical breakup of soil aggregates due to raindrop impact. Rapid soil wetting (in dry soils) and high exchangeable sodium percent can also cause aggregates to disperse. Sealing results when clay and silt particles get detached and/or dispersed and become suspended in the infiltrating water, which is moving downward through surface-connected pores. The pores become clogged with the fine particles, which become closely packed, creating a surface seal. Surface sealing is the initial process in the formation of a mineral crust (Awadhwal and Thierstein, 1985). A soil crust is a broader term for a surface feature that is dense, hard, or restricts infiltration and can be biological or mineral. A seal is a more specific term referring to a surface layer that inhibits infiltration (Heil, 1993). Surface seals decrease infiltration rates, reduce the amount of available water to plants, diminish natural recharge of aquifers, increase runoff, and decrease crop yields (Assouline, 2011). Surface sealing has also been shown to be the primary cause of post-fire runoff and erosion (Larsen et al., 2007).

The intensity and energy of rainfall is an important factor affecting the susceptibility of a soil to form a seal (Moncada et al., 2014). Under most conditions and given enough time, most non-swelling bare soils (soils with low shrink-swell capacity) will become impermeable to water because of clogging of surface pores (Heil, 1993). In swelling soils (soils with high shrink-swell capacity), the formation of surface seals occurs in the zone between the cracks (until the cracks close) and infiltration is thus limited to the vicinity of the crack (Wells et al., 2003). Plant and mulch cover can shield the soil from raindrop impact and so reduce or eliminate sealing in otherwise susceptible soils. Soil management practices that increase organic matter combined with the use of plant or residue cover for protection help control the formation of surface seals in most soils. Because tillage disrupts soil structure and aggregates, it accelerates the formation of seals. Management that minimizes soil disturbances and protects the soil from raindrop impact greatly increases infiltration and reduces runoff.

The interpretation 'Soil Susceptibility to Surface Sealing' is national in scope. The interpretation is only applicable to conditions or times of the year when any portion of the soil surface is exposed to the impact of raindrops and the amount of rain or sprinkler irrigation is significant.  Soils that do not have vegetative, canopy, residue, litter, or duff cover on the surface are the most vulnerable to surface sealing.

Interpretation Summary

Soils are rated based on the degree of susceptibility to surface sealing using a membership function (or degree of membership). Soils can be a non-member, partial member, or complete member of the set of soils that are susceptible to surface sealing. If a soil's property within the surface layer has a membership value greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting and contributes to the soils susceptibility to surface sealing. The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership value for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the interpretive rule 'Soil Susceptibility to Surface Sealing'. Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating values. These are low susceptibility (rating value = 0), moderate susceptibility (rating value > 0 and < 1), and high susceptibility (rating value = 1).

Evaluation Criteria

The interpretive rating is based on the most limiting of four soil properties/indices: exchangeable sodium percentage, organic matter to clay ratio, clay dispersion ratio, and silt/soil crusting index.

1. Exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP).--Too much exchangeable sodium in the surface layer can cause soil particles to disperse. When the water quality is high, such as in rain or snow water, an ESP of 5 can be detrimental to the physical condition of soils (Shainberg and Letey, 1984).

A property (a program with coded instructions; the first part of an interpretation) is used to extract soil properties from the database. The following are calculations and decisions that were applied in the coded instructions:   
-    If ESP is null, then ESP is calculated from the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) based on established relationship and equations in U.S. Salinity Laboratory Staff (1954), Soil Survey Staff (2011), and McBride (1994).
-    If the electrical conductivity (EC) is sufficient to maintain the concentration of salt in the percolating solution above the level where particle dispersion occurs, the rate of water flow through the soil can be maintained at acceptable levels. It is assumed that in surface layers with an EC  8 dS/m (of saturated paste) particle dispersion is not likely to occur and not form a surface seal (very conservative assumption). 
-    According to van der Watt and Valentin (1992) textures most prone to crusting consist of approximately 90% sand and 10% silt and clay. It is probable that in extremely sandy soils the amount of clay, once dispersed, is not sufficient to clog the conducting pores at the soil surface (van der Watt and Valentin, 1992). Therefore, if the amount of silt-sized particles is < 5% and the clay content is < 5% or (clay + silt < 10% and clay < 5%), the soil is unlikely to seal.
 
An evaluation is applied to the data returned from the property (program with coded instructions). The evaluation assesses the ESP for its relative impact on the susceptibility to surface sealing. Data are standardized on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 means low susceptibility and 1 means high susceptibility. Numbers in between represent the degree of susceptibility to surface sealing. The rating classes are defined in a rule that combines results of the ESP, slope, and fragment cover evaluations.

     Property used: SURFACE SEALING - EXCHANGEABLE SODIUM (Modality - representative value)
			
     Exchangeable sodium percent limits:
          Low susceptibility	     <= 1.5%
          Moderate susceptibility      > 1.5% to < 5%
          High susceptibility              >= 5%
		
     Null exchangeable sodium is assigned zero.

    a. Slope:  The limitation of the ESP is reduced based on slope (gradient). Surface sealing intensity is inversely proportional to slope (Poesen, 1984). For heavy vertical rainfall, rainfall intensity and its impact force decreases as the gradient or slope increases (Valentin, 1989). On steep slopes, runoff velocity is sufficient to carry away detach particles, thus reducing the susceptibility to surface sealing.
 
          Slope limits:
               No reduction in susceptibility                   <= 9%
               Increasing reduction in susceptibility      > 9% to < 45%
               Complete reduction in surface sealing    >= 45%

          Null slopes are rated by default as 1.0.

     b. Fragment Cover:  The limitation of the ESP is reduced based on the percent fragment cover. Fragment cover reduces the surface sealing potential. The greater the fragment cover the greater the reduction in surface sealing. Coarse fragments protect the soil surface from raindrop impact (in the same way as mulch). Reduction in raindrop impact decreases the likelihood of aggregate breakdown and thus the potential for surface sealing (van der Watt and Valentin, 1992).

A property (a program with coded instructions; the first part of an interpretation) is used to extract soil properties from the database. The following are calculations and decisions that were applied in the coded instructions:  
-    If surface fragment cover is null, it is calculated from surface fragments in the fragment table or from rock fragments and sieves in the horizon table (in the database).

          Fragment cover limits:
               No reduction in susceptibility                   <= 15%
               Increasing reduction in susceptibility      > 15% to < 80%
               Complete reduction in surface sealing    >= 80%

         Null surface fragments are rated by default as 1.0.

2. Organic matter to clay ratio (organic matter/total clay x 100).--The soil organic matter to clay ratio decreases with decreasing soil structural stability. An organic matter to clay ratio > 7% is considered to have a favorable influence on soil structural stability (Valentin, 1989). Soils with good structural stability are less likely to form surface seals. A soil organic carbon to clay ratio of 1:10 (organic carbon x 1.72/10 x 100 = 17.2%) was considered the limit between good and medium structural quality by Johannes et al. (2017).

A property (a program with coded instructions; the first part of an interpretation) is used to extract soil properties from the database. The following are calculations and decisions that were applied in the coded instructions:  
-    The organic matter to clay ratio (Valentin, 1989) is calculated for the surface layer.
-    Surface soils with > 20% organic matter (organic soils) are considered non-limiting or not likely to form surface seals.
-    Soils with EC > 4 dS/m are generally flocculated and are considered not likely to form surface seals. 
-    Water-dispersible clay (WDC) for soils with gypsum is considered non-limiting. If gypsum >= 1%, the soil is considered not likely to seal. 
-    According to van der Watt and Valentin (1992) textures most prone to crusting consist of approximately 90% sand and 10% silt and clay. It is probable that in extremely sandy soils the amount of clay, once dispersed, is not sufficient to clog the conducting pores at the soil surface (van der Watt and Valentin, 1992). Therefore, if the amount of silt-sized particles is < 5% and the clay content is < 5% or (clay + silt < 10% and clay < 5%), the soil is unlikely to seal.

An evaluation is applied to the data returned from the property (program with coded instructions). It assesses the clay dispersion ratio for its relative impact on the susceptibility to surface sealing. Data are standardized on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 means low susceptibility and 1 means high susceptibility. Numbers in between represent the degree of susceptibility to surface sealing. The rating classes are defined in a rule that combines the organic matter to clay ratio, slope, and fragment cover evaluations.

     Property used: SURFACE SEALING - ORGANIC MATTER CLAY RATIO (Modality - representative value)
			
     Organic matter to clay ratio limits:
          Low susceptibility	     >= 17%
          Moderate susceptibility      > 7% to < 17%
          High susceptibility              <= 7%
		
     Null organic matter to clay ratio is assigned null.

     a. Slope:  The limitation of the organic matter to clay ratio is reduced based on slope (see 1a).

          Slope limits:
               No reduction in susceptibility                   <= 9%
               Increasing reduction in susceptibility      > 9% to < 45%
               Complete reduction in surface sealing    >= 45%

     b. Fragment Cover:  The limitation of the organic matter to clay ratio is reduced based on the percent fragment cover (see 2b).

          Fragment cover limits:
               No reduction in susceptibility                   <= 15%
               Increasing reduction in susceptibility      > 15% to < 80%
               Complete reduction in surface sealing    >= 80%

3. Clay dispersion ratio (water dispersible clay/total clay).--Water dispersible clays are soil particles < 2 microns that can be easily dispersed in soil water (Soil Survey Staff, 2011). The propensity of the clay fraction to disperse in water affects surface sealing and crust formation and thus erodibility (Brubaker et al., 1992). The clay dispersion ratio was found to be a good index for predicting the erodibility of soils of southeastern Nigeria (Igwe, 2005). The dispersion ratio (silt + clay in suspension/[total silt + clay]) was shown to be the single most valuable criterion in distinguishing between erosive and nonerosive soils (Middleton, 1930). It was suggested that a dispersion ratio of less than 0.15 can be considered nonerosive, indicating that the soil infiltration is adequate to prevent erosion and thus, surface sealing.

A property (a program with coded instructions; the first part of an interpretation) is used to extract soil properties from the database. The following are calculations and decisions that were applied in the coded instructions:  
-    Clays with lower charge densities are nearly twice as dispersible as those with higher charge densities (Brubaker et al., 1992). Different equations for predicting water dispersible clay (and thus clay dispersion) were used based on the charge density of the clay (Brubaker et al., 1992). 
-    If the OM content was > 9%, clay dispersion was not evaluated (limit of the calibration datasets in Brubaker et al., 1992). 
-    The organic matter to clay ratio takes precedence over the clay dispersion ratio. Clay dispersion is not evaluated for organic matter to clay ratios > 0.17 where the organic matter content is > 2.5% (minimum range of the dataset that determined the 0.17 limit). These soils have been shown to have very good structure by Johannes et al. (2017) and are not likely to form a surface seal. 
-    For soils with high carbonates, an equation was developed from the soil characterization database predicting water dispersible clays on soils where CaCO3 content was >= 10 (with minimal EC and no gypsum was present). 
-    The contribution of poorly crystalline Fe oxides in forming stable aggregates equals or exceeds that of organic carbon (OC) in soils with low organic matter contents (Duiker et al., 2014). An equation for predicting water-dispersible clay for soils with large amounts of Fe and Al oxides was developed from the characterization database where oxalate extractable Fe content was > 2%. 
-    According to van der Watt and Valentin (1992) textures most prone to crusting consist of approximately 90% sand and 10% silt and clay. It is probable that in extremely sandy soils the amount of clay, once dispersed, is not sufficient to clog the conducting pores at the soil surface (van der Watt and Valentin, 1992). Therefore, if the amount of silt-sized particles is < 5% and the clay content is < 5% or (clay + silt < 10% and clay < 5%), the soil is unlikely to seal. 
-    Soils with EC > 4 dS/m are generally flocculated and are considered not likely to seal. 
-    Water-dispersible clay (WDC) for soils with gypsum is non-limiting. If gypsum >= 1%, the soil is considered not likely to seal.
 
An evaluation is applied to the data returned from the property (program with coded instructions). It assesses the clay dispersion ratio for its relative impact on the susceptibility to surface sealing. Data are standardized on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 means low susceptibility and 1 means high susceptibility. Numbers in between represent the degree of susceptibility to surface sealing. The rating classes are described in the rule that combines the clay dispersion ratio, slope, and fragment cover evaluations. 
			
     Clay dispersion ratio limits:
          Low susceptibility	     <= 0.15
          Moderate susceptibility      > 0.15 to < 0.5
          High susceptibility              >= 0.5
		
     Null clay dispersion ratio is assigned null.

     a. Slope:  The limitation of the clay dispersion ratio is reduced based on slope (see 1a).

          Slope limits:
               No reduction in susceptibility                   <= 9%
               Increasing reduction in susceptibility      > 9% to < 45%
               Complete reduction in surface sealing    >= 45%

     b. Fragment Cover:  The limitation of the clay dispersion ratio is reduced based on the percent fragment cover (see 1b).

          Fragment cover limits:
               No reduction in susceptibility                   <= 15%
               Increasing reduction in susceptibility      > 15% to < 80%
               Complete reduction in surface sealing    >= 80%

4. Silt/soil crusting index (silt/[clay + [organic matter x 10]]).--Soils low in clay and organic matter and high in silt are highly prone to sealing and crusting (Moncada et al., 2014). A crusting index < 0.2 indicates no crust formation, and a value > 2 is considered a critical limit for soils that have a high susceptibility to seal and form crusts.

A property (a program with coded instructions; the first part of an interpretation) is used to extract soil properties from the database. The following are calculations and decisions that were applied in the coded instructions:  
-    The silt/crusting index used is described in Moncada et al. (2014). Total silt is used as a proxy for (1.5 x fine silt) + (0.75 x coarse silt) in the index.
-    Soils with > 20% organic matter are not evaluated. Organic soil surface layers are considered non-limiting.  
-    Soils with EC > 4 dS/m are generally flocculated and are considered not likely to seal. 
-    Water-dispersible clay (WDC) for soils with gypsum is non-limiting. If gypsum >= 1%, the soil is considered not likely to seal. 
-    According to van der Watt and Valentin (1992) textures most prone to sealing and crusting consist of approximately 90% sand and 10% silt and clay. It is probable that in extremely sandy soils the amount of clay, once dispersed, is not sufficient to clog the conducting pores at the soil surface (van der Watt and Valentin, 1992). Therefore, if the amount of silt-sized particles is < 5% and the clay content is < 5% or (clay + silt < 10% and clay < 5%), the soil is unlikely to seal.
-    The organic matter to clay ratio takes precedence over the silt/crusting index. The silt/crusting index is not evaluated for organic matter to clay ratios > 0.17 where the organic matter content is > 2.5% (minimum range of the dataset that determined the 0.17 limit). These soils have been shown to have very good structure by Johannes et al. (2017) and are not likely to form a surface seal.

An evaluation is applied to the data returned from the property (program with coded instructions). It assesses the silt/crusting index for its relative impact on the susceptibility to surface sealing. Data are standardized on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 means low susceptibility and 1 means high susceptibility. Numbers in between represent the degree of susceptibility to surface sealing. The rating classes are described in the rule that combines the silt/soil crusting index, slope, and fragment cover evaluations.

     Property used: SURFACE SEALING - CRUSTING INDEX (Modality - representative value)
			
     Crusting index limits:
          Low susceptibility	     <= 0.2
          Moderate susceptibility      > 0.2 to < 2.0
          High susceptibility              >= 2.0
		
     A Null crusting index is assigned null.

     a. Slope:  The limitation of the silt/crusting index is reduced based on slope (see 1a).

          Slope limits:
               No reduction in susceptibility                   <= 9%
               Increasing reduction in susceptibility      > 9% to < 45%
               Complete reduction in surface sealing    >= 45%

     b. Fragment Cover:  The limitation of the silt/crusting index is reduced based on the percent fragment cover (see 1b).

          Fragment cover limits:
               No reduction in susceptibility                   <= 15%
               Increasing reduction in susceptibility      > 15% to < 80%
               Complete reduction in surface sealing    >= 80%

The purpose of this soil interpretation is to identify subaqueous soils that have the potential to produce acid sulfate soils when dredged and placed on the land surface. This interpretation is rated as a limitation, with soils containing any sulfidic materials within 200 centimeters from the soil surface being ranked as limited for land utilization of dredged materials. Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices for reduced monosulfides, oxidized pH,  and subaqueous drainage.  These are Not Limited (rating index = 0)  or  Limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:
Land utilization of dredged material is the using of subaqueous soil material as fill in a subaerial environment.  Some subaqueous soils have reduced monosulphides that, when exposed to oxygen, begin to oxidize and release sulphuric acid, which can be very damaging to the environment and any adjacent infrastructure.      

Scope: Subaqueous environments
The soil property that influences the feasibility of using the dredged material as fill is the presence of reduced monosulfides.  Reduced monosulfides are compounds produced under oxygen-depleted conditions when iron present within soils or sediments combines with sulfur from sulfate to form iron sulfides, in particular pyrite (FeS2). When these sulfides are disturbed and exposed to air, oxidation occurs and sulfuric acid is produced. The resulting pH can frequently be below 3.0, which liberates aluminum, which is toxic to plant roots in high concentrations.  The soil interpretive results for "" Land Utilization of Dredged Material"" are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use. Ratings are based on properties and qualities affecting the capacity of the soil to generate acidity when exposed to air.

Criteria:
For this interpretation, soils that contain reduced monosulfides and/or have a low oxidized pH reading may negatively impact the use of dredge material for upland utilization. The presence of reduced monosulfides in the soil as indicated by a soil color change within 10 seconds following the addition of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide solution. The color change is usually an increase in value by 2 or more units. Oxidized pH is used to test for the presence of sulfidic material and to predict the occurrence of sulfuric horizons. For this interpretation, soils are considered potential acid sulfate soils if the sulfide material is waterlogged mineral, organic, or mixed soil material with a pH of 3.5 or higher and if incubated as a 1-cm thick layer under moist, aerobic conditions (field capacity) at room temperature, shows a drop in pH of 0.5 or more units to a pH value of 4.0 or less within 16 weeks or longer until the pH is nearly constant (if the pH is still dropping after 16 weeks) (Soil Survey Staff, 2014)."|07/13/2018 19:14:11|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666561"
"TX201"|"SAS - Mooring Anchor - Deadweight"|"limitation"|"Introduction
A mooring refers to a structure or anchor used to hold secure a boat in a certain area, with a float or buoy attached. Years ago, only inner harbors were used for mooring areas. Safety of a boat on a mooring depends on a number of elements; one of them is the type of bottom or soil materials.

Purpose
One fact that stood out about storms was that a significant number of mooring failures were vessels driven ashore with their moorings. Why then did these vessels drag their moorings ashore fully intact? Was the wrong type of anchor used for the soil type? It should be noted that safety of a boat on a mooring depends on four elements of the mooring system. The first is the strength and design of the desk hardware (cleats, etc.); second is the strength of the mooring lines (rodes); third is the integrity of the chains or shackles leading to the anchor system; and fourth is the resistance of the anchoring system to being pulled out of the soil. Without the knowledge of what type of anchor is used and what type of soil material it is set in, the holding capacity of the mooring is compromised. The type of soil material has a great deal to do with the holding power of anchors. 

There are two primary classes of anchorstemporary and permanent. A permanent anchor is often called a mooring, and is rarely moved; it is quite possible the vessel cannot hoist it aboard but must hire a service to move or maintain it. The anchor needs to hold the vessel in all weathers, including the most severe storms, but only occasionally, or never, needs to be lifted. Two common types of permanent anchors are the mushroom and deadweight anchors. The deadweight anchor is the focus of this soil interpretation. 

Deadweight Anchors
Deadweight anchors work on the principle of being heavy. Whether the anchor is a block of stone, concrete, or iron its holding power is weight (see Figure 6). Deadweight anchors provide the greatest reliability. They are the best choice for rocky, gravelly, or sandy soils with low n-value soil surface layers or hard bottom types of material. If they are dragged, they will resist with constant force. By contrast, once a mushroom anchor breaks free, it will not reset and will simply skip along the bottom. Granite is a common choice of material in the Northeast as it is readily available and inexpensive. It is a bit awkward to handle, but once in position, it will not move. The further one travels south from northern New England, concrete and iron become more common (INAMAR, 2000). 

Deadweight anchors are used where mushroom anchors are unsuitable. An advantage of a deadweight anchor over a mushroom is that if it does become dragged, then it continues to provide its original holding force. The disadvantage of using deadweight anchors in conditions where a mushroom anchor could be used is that it needs to be around ten times the weight of the equivalent mushroom anchor.

Soils rated for mooring type using deadweights are either not limited, somewhat limited, or very limited. Not limited means the soil has low n-value soil surface layers or a hard bottom type of material in which deadweights work the best. Very limited means the soil has high n-value soil surface layers or a soft bottom type of material in which the use of deadweights is not suitable. 

Soil Ratings
Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices. The rating indices finds the sum of the horizon thicknesses having each n-value condition between 0 and 150 centimeters. The n-value associated with the highest sum of horizon thicknesses is used to place the soil into a rating class. The rating classes are very limited, somewhat limited, not limited, and not rated. 

Very Limited: 
Soils with a high n-value (very fluid) between 0 and 150 centimeters from the soil surface are rated very limited for deadweight anchors.

Somewhat Limited:
Soils with an n-value of slightly and/or moderately fluid between 0 and 150 centimeters from the soil surface are rated somewhat limited for deadweight anchors. 

Not Limited: 
Soils with a low n-value (nonfluid) between 0 and 150 centimeters from the soil surface are rated not limited for deadweight anchors. 

Not Rated: Soils or miscellanous areas that do not have a subaqueous drainage class are not rated.

Two common types of permanent anchors are the mushroom and deadweight anchors. The mushroom anchor is the focus of this soil interpretation. 

Mushroom Anchors
A mushroom anchor is shaped like an inverted mushroom; the head becoming buried in the soil (see Figure 5). These anchors work best in loamy to organic soils with high n-value surface layers or soft bottom types of material when they are left in and allowed to set. These anchors work on the principle of surface area and suction effect. Cohesion of the bottom material is very important. Rocks, gravel, or coarse sand lack good cohesive properties allowing the anchor to pull free. Mushroom anchors in sand will not bury completely. They will only sink to displace an equal weight of sand. Their large round dish design is not well-suited to penetrating the bottom. A rocky or coarse sand bottom is not a good place for mushroom anchors (INAMAR, 2000). 

Soils rated for mooring type using the mushroom anchors are either not limited or very limited. Not limited means the soil is a soft bottom type of material in which the mushroom anchor works the best. Very limited means the soil is a hard bottom type of material in which the use of a mushroom anchor is not suitable. Navigational channels are not rated because boats cannot anchor in a channel unless circumstances require the boat to anchor, such as being broken down.


Soils rated for mooring type using deadweights are either not limited, somewhat limited, or very limited. Not limited means the soil has low n-value soil surface layers or a hard bottom type of material in which deadweights work the best. Very limited means the soil has high n-value soil surface layers or a soft bottom type of material in which the use of deadweights is not suitable. 

Soil Ratings
Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices. The rating indices finds the sum of the horizon thicknesses having each n-value condition between 0 and 150 centimeters. The n-value associated with the highest sum of horizon thicknesses is used to place the soil into a rating class. The rating classes are very limited, somewhat limited, not limited, and not rated. 

Very Limited: 
Soils with a low n-value (nonfluid) between 0 and 150 centimeters from the soil surface are rated very limited for mushroom anchors. 

Somewhat Limited:
Soils with an n-value of slightly and/or moderately fluid between 0 and 150 centimeters from the soil surface are rated somewhat limited for mushroom anchors. 

Not Limited: 
Soils with a high n-value (very fluid) between 0 and 150 centimeters from the soil surface are rated not limited for mushroom anchors. Mushroom anchors are available in different sized from 15-20 pound anchors suitable for boats to 15 feet to almost 1500 pound huge mushroom anchors for ships and large size vessels. A 350 pound mushroom typically sets at least 5 feet deep in mud, meaning there is roughly a 2,000 pound breakout force. For a 500 pound mushroom anchor set in sand, there is roughly a 1,700 pound breakout force (CraigMarine, 2016).

Not Rated: Soils or miscellanous areas that do not have a subaqueous drainage class are not rated.

"TX201"|"SOH - Concentration of Salts- Soil Surface"|"limitation"|"Salts of sodium, calcium, potassium, and magnesium are produced by the weathering of minerals in soils.  Some salts can be added to the surface due to aeolian deposition.  Excess salts can be concentrated in soils when precipitation is sufficient to move salts within the soil but of insufficient quantity to move the salts out of the soil.  Salts move downward with percolating precipitation from the generally convex recharge areas of the landscape to the generally concave discharge areas.  Net water movement can be upward in these areas due to evapotranspiration or water movement may be more or less horizontal due to restrictive layers or differences in water transmission rates.  

Criteria:
1. The soil must exist in a non-leaching environment.  In areas where salt accumulates in the soil, precipitation does not exceed evapotranspiration, thus excess salts do not move vertically or laterally through the soil profile and thence into ground or surface waters.  A method for estimating potential evapotranspiration is described by Hamon (1967) and is used here, since it does not require as many data inputs as other PET models.  To determine whether or not a climate generally causes leaching or not, the mean annual precipitation is subtracted from the potential evapotranspiration.  When the precipitation deficit exceeds 100mm the climate is considered to no longer cause leaching in most soils.   
   
Property evaluated: MAP MINUS POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION (UPDATED)
                Leaching                  MAP-PET >10mm/yr

               Non-leaching            MAP-PET <-100 mm

2.  The soil surface and subsurface must generally concentrate water flow.  Research has shown that in regions where rainfall is limited the concave parts of the landscape also concentrate subsurface water flow as well as surface flow.  The shape of the land surface curvature in the up-down and across directions is considered.  The shape can be convex, linear, or concave in both the up and down or across orientations.  Areas that are concave up-down and linear across are the best at concentrating salts at the soil surface.  This basically describes the footslopes of stream channels.

3. Presence of salts.  Excess salts must exist in the soil in order to have movement and surface concentration.  The concentration of excess salts in soils is estimated by measuring the electrical conductivity of the soil.

Property evaluated:  WEIGHTED AVERAGE ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY 0-150cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION

Somewhat salty      EC 0-4 dS/m
Salty                       EC >4 dS/m

4.  Depth to and persistence of seasonal high water.  Salts move through soil when water flows.  Most water movement happens when the soil is saturated, thus, the depth to saturation and its temporal persistence influence whether or not salts will remain deep in the profile or be carried to the surface.  If the water table remains deep the salts will accumulate deeper in the profile.  If the water table is close enough to the surface that capillary rise and evapotranspiration can bring water to the soil surface, salts will accumulate at the surface.

A fertile and healthy soil is the basis for healthy plants, animals, and humans.  Soil organic matter is the very foundation for healthy and productive soils. Understanding the role of organic matter in maintaining a healthy soil is essential for developing ecologically sound agricultural practices.   Perhaps just as important is identifying areas at greater risk of depleting that organic matter.  The accumulation of organic matter in soil is the result of the processes that synthesize organic matter being able to generally out-produce the processes that destroy organic matter.  These processes act on continental and local scales.  Continental factors include the mean annual temperature which ultimately governs the rates of biological processes, both synthesizing and destroying organic matter. Another continental scale factor is the amount of moisture generally available for plants and soil microbes to use.  This is governed by the amount of rainfall an area receives in relation to the potential evapotranspiration.

These continental scale factors are modified by local factors that influence organic matter accumulation or destruction.  Oxygen is needed for both processes.  Oxygen can be excluded from the soil by seasonal saturation, which generally favors the accumulation processes.  The antecedent organic matter content is used as an indicator of the level of vulnerability of the soil to loss of organic matter.  Well aerated soils, all other things being equal, tend to promote higher oxidation rates but may still accumulate organic matter depending on the other factors, ground cover, and management.  The amount of clay-sized particles in the soil influences the protection of organic compounds and so tends to favor accumulation.  The shape of the land surface also influences the organic matter content of soils.  Concave areas tend to accumulate water and sediment while convex areas are material spreading.

Organic soils used in agricultural production are subject to a loss of volume and depth of organic material due to oxidation caused by above normal microbial activity resulting from excessive water drainage, soil disturbance, or extended drought. Microbial mediated oxidation is the primary driver of volume reduction once water is removed.   Soil shrinkage and compaction due to dewatering is considered to be secondary. Any drawdown resulting in water levels below soil surface can result in increased subsidence rates.  The subsidence rate can also be influenced by agricultural practices. The type of tillage operation, such as plowing, disc harrowing and switch plowing, moldboard plowing increase the oxidation rate.  The use of  no-till practice is recommended to slow the subsidence. Any aggressive tillage measure increases microbiological activity and decreases carbon sequestration.  Drainage water management can be implemented to control water tables to help slow the subsidence rate.

Climate

Organic soils occur in temperate lowlands and cool mountain areas; only one-tenth of all Histosols are found in the tropics.  Organic soils that formed in plant material under the permanent influence of groundwater (`low moor peat') occupy the lower parts of fluvial, lacustrine and marine landscapes, mainly in temperate regions.  Organic soils  in lacustrine landforms are commonly associated with Vertisols.  Rain-dependent organic soils  are found in environments with sufficiently high and evenly spread rainfall, e.g. in raised `dome' peat formations (`high moor peat') in lowland areas and in upland areas with blanket peat, where a paucity of nutrient elements, acidity and near-permanent wetness retard decay of organic debris.  Organic soil materials in northern regions could accumulate there because decay of organic debris is retarded by frost in the cold season and by prolonged water-saturation of the thawed surface soil during summer. Permafrost-affected organic soils  are associated with Cryosols and with soils that have gleyic or stagnic properties, e.g. Gleysols in Alaska and in the northern part of the former USSR. 

Hydrology

The surface 10 cm of the soil most reactive. The loss of soil material due to oxidation is directly related to depth of drainage. The rate of loss of drained organic soils (up to a few inches per year) can be 100 times greater than the natural rate of accumulation (a few inches per 100 years) of organic soils. The direction of water movement is also important because of the dissolved materials that move with the water.  A rain-fed fen has more oxygen available than bog, which is saturated by groundwater.  However, fens have more cations in solution and generally have a more basic pH.  Bogs are typically more acidic. Maintaining the water table (water saturation to exclude oxygen) in the soil profile slows the rate of decomposition since anaerobic decomposition is slower than aerobic decomposition.   

Material

Histosols are unlike all other soils in that they are formed in organic soil material with physical, chemical and mechanical properties that differ strongly from those of mineral soil materials. Morphological characteristics includes large pore volume typically greater than 85 percent.  They contain at least 20-30 percent  organic matter by weight and are more than 40 cm thick. Bulk densities are quite low, often less than 0.3 g cm3.  Organic soil material accumulates in conditions where plant matter is produced by an adapted (""climax"") vegetation, and where decomposition of plant debris is slowed by low temperatures, persistent water saturation of the soil body, extreme acidity or paucity of nutrient elements (""oligotrophy""), and/or high levels of electrolytes or organic toxins.  The existing degree of decomposition influences the rate of further decomposition, since the remaining organic material becomes more resistant to decomposition.

Soil interpretations for woodland management provide a means of assessing the limitations and potentials of soils for various operations.  Identification of sites that are difficult to manage will assist in the timing of the work to be done in the forest.  The characteristics of the site and soil can greatly impact the success of the woodland management in terms of efficiency and avoidance of environmental degradation.  

Soils can be a non-members, partial members or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Mechanical Planting Suitability"".  If a soil's property within 30 cm (12 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Mechanical Planting Suitability"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through timing or management.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are well suited (rating index = 0), moderately suited (rating index > 0 and < 0.5), or poorly suited  (rating index >= 0.5 and <1.0) and unsuited  (rating index = 1).

Description:

Mechanical planting suitability addresses the difficulty of planting trees or shrubs using a mechanical planter.  Mechanical planters typically create narrow furrows or trenches to a depth of about 30cm and are operated on the contour or cross-slope.  The planter can be an implement attached to a sufficiently powered tractor on a 3-point hitch.  The planter has a coulter, shank or trench shoe, and packing wheel to open a furrow, insert the bareroot stock, tublings, containerized stock, or cuttings, and then close the furrow.  It is assumed that planting activities occur during customary periods of such work for the local area in order to avoid saturated or ponded soils.  Also, necessary site preparation is completed before mechanical planting.   The presence of non-soil obstacles, e.g., slash, human-caused compacted layers from harvesting or other site activities (only natural restrictive layers are considered), and frozen or snow-covered soils are not considered.

Soil and site properties that may impact the use of a mechanical planter are the depth to a shallow restrictive layer, the slope of the land surface, the rock fragment content of the surface and the rock fragment coverage of the site, the sandiness or stickiness of the surface layers, and excess water.  These all impact the use and effectiveness of equipment.

Rating Classes:

* Well Suited - Little or no restrictions to mechanical planting; planting rates are not affected.
* Moderately Suited - One or more restrictions that impede planting and reduce planting rates.
* Poorly Suited - One or more restrictions that severely impede planting and reduce planting rates.
* Unsuited - Site factors and features prevent mechanical planting of seedlings.

Criteria Used:

1) Restrictive Layer Limitation - Mechanical planting implements require a certain depth of workable soil in order to function properly.  The soil must be deep enough so that the machine may open a furrow, insert the propagation material at an appropriate depth, and then close the furrow.  A restrictive layer may prevent the planter from performing this.  Layers that restrict root penetration may not prevent penetration by the planter, thus restrictive layers are differentiated on the basis of their hardness.  Layers that are indurated are likely to be impenetrable by the planter so the presence of a layer of this hardness within 30 cm of the soil surface is very limiting.  Layers that are very strongly or strongly cemented are somewhat limiting if they are present within 30 cm of the soil surface.  Noncemented limiting layers are slightly limiting if present within 30 cm of the soil surface.

A. Depth to Indurated Layer <30cm
Properties evaluated: 
DEPTH TO INDURATED LAYER (Modality - High, Low, Representative value)
Restriction limits:
		Limiting		<= 25 cm
		Somewhat limiting	25-30 cm
		Not limiting	>= 30 cm
The fuzzy number is not modified.

B. Depth to Strongly/Very Strongly Cemented Layer <30cm
DEPTH TO STRONGLY/VERY STRONGLY CEMENTED LAYER (Modality - High, Low, Representative value)
Restriction limits:
		Limiting		<= 25 cm
		Somewhat limiting	25-30 cm
		Not limiting	>= 30 cm
The fuzzy number is multiplier by 0.5 to reduce the impact.

C. Depth to Noncemented Restrictive Layer <30cm
DEPTH TO NONCEMENTED RESTRICTIVE LAYER (Modality - High, Low, Representative value)
Restriction limits:
		Limiting		<= 25 cm
		Somewhat limiting	25-30 cm
		Not limiting	>= 30 cm
The fuzzy number is multiplier by 0.25 to reduce the impact.

The maximum fuzzy number of rules A-C is returned as the rating for this rule.

2) Slope: Steep slopes impede trafficability of machinery and can be a safety risk.  Soil feature considered is the component slope.
		
Property used: SLOPE (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
Restriction limits:
		Limiting		> 35%
		Somewhat limiting	>= 5 and <= 35%
		Not limiting	< 5%			
		
Null Slope is assigned Not rated.

3) Sand Limitation - A lack of soil cohesion caused by an excessive sand content in the soil can disrupt the planting process.   If the weighted average of total particle separates coarser than very fine sand are >=80% for the soil within 30cm then this rule returns a value greater than 0 and sand is a limiting feature.

Property used: PARTICLES COARSER VFS IN LAYERS >=7CM THICK, DEPTH 0-30CM  (Modality -  representative value)

Restriction limits:
		Limiting		> 85  percent retained on the number 200 sieve
		Somewhat limiting	>= 80 and <= 85  percent retained on the number 200 sieve
		Not limiting	< 80  percent retained on the number 200 sieve			
The fuzzy number from this rule is multiplied by 0.5 to reduce its impact.		
Null  number 200 sieve is assigned Not rated.

4) Stickiness Limitation - Soils having high (>30) plasticity indices are sticky.  Soil can clog the planting mechanisms and reduce efficiency because of the need for frequent cleaning.  If the plasticity index of a soil component is >=20 for the any layer within 30cm then this rule returns a value greater than 0 and stickiness is a limiting feature. 

Property evaluated: 
PLASTICITY INDEX MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-30CM (Modality - High, Low, Representative value)
Restriction limits:
		Limiting		Plasticity index > 30
		Somewhat limiting	Plasticity index >= 20 - <=30
		Not limiting	Plasticity index < 20
The fuzzy number is multiplied by 0.75 to reduce the impact of this property.
Null plasticity index is assigned ""not rated"".

5) Rock Fragments Limitation - The presence of excessive rock fragments, either contained in the soil or on the soil surface, can impede planting operations.  Rock fragments in the soil can reduce the penetration of the planter and also cause an unfavorable seedbed.  Large fragments on the soil surface can damage the planting equipment and may present an obstacle to the path of the vehicle.  If rock fragments fall within the following parameters then this rule returns a value greater than 0 and rock fragments are a limiting feature.

Size			Rock Fragment %
----			---------------
>=75mm			>=.01	Surface Cover
>=75mm			>=5	Within 30cm
2-75mm			>=15	Within 30cm

A. Fragments <15% to >60% (>=2 and <75mm) Within 30cm
Property evaluated: FRAGMENTS >=2MM AND <75MM MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-30CM (Modality: High, Low, Representative value)
Restriction limits:
		Limiting		Rock fragments >2 to < 75mm  > 60 percent
		Somewhat limiting	Rock fragments >2 to < 75mm  >= 15 - <=60 percent
		Not limiting	Rock fragments >2 to < 75mm  < 15 percent
Null Rock fragment content is assigned ""not rated"".

B. Fragments <5% to >35% (>=75mm) Within 30cm
Property evaluated: FRAGMENTS >=75MM MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-30CM (Modality: High, Low, Representative value)
Restriction limits:
		Limiting		Rock fragments > 75mm  > 35 percent
		Somewhat limiting	Rock fragments > 75mm  >= 5 - <=35 percent
		Not limiting	Rock fragments > 75mm  < 5 percent
Null Rock fragment content is assigned ""not rated"".

C. Fragments <0.1% to >15% Surface Cover (>75mm)
Property evaluated: FRAGMENTS >=75MM ON THE SURFACE (Modality: High, Low, Representative value)
Restriction limits:
		Limiting		Rock fragments > 75mm  cover > 15 percent
		Somewhat limiting	Rock fragments > 75mm  cover >= 0.1 - <=15 percent
		Not limiting	Rock fragments > 75mm  cover < 0.1 percent
Null Rock fragment cover is assigned ""not limiting"".

The maximum fuzzy number of rules A-C is returned as the rating for this rule.

6) Wetness Limitation - Excessive soil moisture can seriously limit planting operations.  The soil can be too wet due to internal moisture (water table) or from ponding.  Both of these characteristics have a temporal aspect, meaning that at some time during the year, a soil that is often wet may be dry enough to work.   If the depth to a layer with wet soil moisture is =<15cm for 12 months of the year OR the soil component has frequent or occasional ponding for 12 months of the year then the rule returns a value greater than 0 and wetness is a limiting feature.

A. Depth to Water Table <15 to >30cm, Year Long
1. Property evaluated: DEPTH TO WET SOIL LAYER MAXIMUM  (Modality -  Representative value)
Restriction limits:
		Limiting		<= 15 cm
		Somewhat limiting	15-30 cm
		Not limiting	>= 30 cm
The fuzzy number is multiplied by 0.75 to reduce the impact.

2. Property evaluated: MONTHS WITH WET SOIL MOISTURE STATUS  (Modality - High, Low, Representative value)
Restriction limits:
		Limiting		= 12 months
		Somewhat limiting	8 to 11 months
		Not limiting	< 8 months
The fuzzy number is multiplied by 0.75 to reduce the impact.

The lowest fuzzy number of A1 or A2 is returned to the rule.

B. Months with Frequent or Occasional Ponding
MONTHS WITH FREQUENT OR OCCASIONAL PONDING
Restriction limits:
		Limiting		= 12 months
		Somewhat limiting	8 to 11 months
		Not limiting	< 8 months
The fuzzy number is multiplied by 0.75 to reduce the impact.
The highest fuzzy number of A or B is returned to the rule.

Description:
Mechanical site preparation (deep) addresses the difficulty of using deep soil tillage equipment to prepare a site for planting trees or shrubs.  These activities include machinery for subsoiling, ripping, and other subsurface soil disturbance and are operated on the contour or cross-slope.  Deep site preparation activities may treat up to 50 to 75 percent of the site to up to 90 cm in depth to break up restrictive or compacted layers to increase water infiltration for plant growth.  Operationally, this includes the use of rippers, subsoilers, and other implements pulled by bulldozers (D8 or equivalent) that till at a depth greater than 30 cm. It is assumed that planting activities occur during customary periods of such work for the local area in order to avoid saturated or ponded soils.   The presence of non-soil obstacles, e.g., slash, human-caused compacted layers from harvesting or other site activities are not considered (only natural restrictive layers are considered).  Frozen or snow-covered soils are not considered.
Soil and site properties that may impact the use machinery for deep site preparation are the depth to a shallow restrictive layer, the slope of the land surface, the rock fragment content of the surface and the rock fragment coverage of the site, and excess water.  These all impact the use and effectiveness of equipment.

Rating Classes:

* Suited - Little or no restrictions to deep mechanical site preparation.
* Moderately suited - One or more restrictions may reduce the effective and safe use of equipment.
* Poorly Suited - One or more restrictions reduce the effective and safe use of equipment.
* Unsuited - One or more restrictions generally prevent a sufficient level of deep mechanical site preparation.

Criteria Used:

1) Restrictive Layer Limitation -  Deep site preparation implements require a certain depth of workable soil in order to function properly.  A restrictive layer may prevent the planter from performing this.  Layers that restrict root penetration may not prevent penetration by the equipment, thus restrictive layers are differentiated on the basis of their hardness.  Layers that are indurated are likely to be unrippable the presence of a layer of this hardness within 60 cm of the soil surface is very limiting.  Thick layers that are very strongly or strongly cemented are limiting if they are present within 60 cm of the soil surface, but are less limiting if they are thin.   Noncemented limiting layers are slightly limiting if present within 60 cm of the soil surface.
A. Depth to Indurated Layer <50 to >90cm
Properties evaluated:  DEPTH TO INDURATED LAYER
Restriction limits:
		Limiting		<= 50 cm
		Somewhat limiting	50-90 cm
		Not limiting	>= 90 cm
The fuzzy number is not modified.

Property used: SLOPE
		
Restriction limits:
		Limiting		> 35%
		Somewhat limiting	>= 15 and <= 35%
		Not limiting	 < 15%			
		
Null Slope is assigned to the Not rated class.

3) Rock Fragments Limitation - The presence of excessive rock fragments, either contained in the soil or on the soil surface, can impede site preparation operations.  Rock fragments in the soil can reduce the efficiency of the implement.  Large fragments on the soil surface can damage the site preparation equipment and may present an obstacle to the path of the vehicle.  If rock fragments fall within the following parameters then this rule returns a value greater than 0 and rock fragments are a limiting feature.

The maximum fuzzy number of rules 3A or 3B is returned as the rating for this rule.

4) Wetness Limitation - Excessive soil moisture can seriously limit deep mechanical site preparation operations.  The soil can be too wet due to internal moisture (water table) or from ponding.  Both of these characteristics have a temporal aspect, meaning that at some time during the year, a soil that is often wet may be dry enough to work.   If the depth to a layer with wet soil moisture is =<40cm for 8 months of the year OR the soil component has frequent or occasional ponding for 8 months of the year then the rule returns a value greater than 0 and wetness is a limiting feature.

Soil interpretations for woodland management provide a means of assessing the limitations and potentials of soils for various operations.  Identification of sites that are difficult to manage will assist in the timing of the work to be done in the forest.  The characteristics of the site and soil can greatly impact the success of the woodland management in terms of efficiency and avoidance of environmental degradation.  

Soils can be a non-members, partial members or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Mechanical Site Preparation (Surface)"".  If a soil's property within 30 cm (12 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Mechanical Site Preparation (Surface)"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through timing or management.
Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are well suited (rating index = 0), moderately suited (rating index > 0 and < 0.75), or poorly suited (rating index >= 0.75 and <1.0) and unsuited (rating index = 1).

Description:
Mechanical site preparation (surface) addresses the difficulty of using surface-altering soil tillage equipment to prepare a site for planting trees or seeding.   Surface site preparation activities may treat up to 50 to 75 percent of the site to up to 30 cm in depth to break up restrictive or compacted layers to increase water infiltration for plant growth.  Operationally, this includes the use brush rakes, chisels, disks and other similar types of implements pulled by bulldozers or tractors (D6/D7, 150 horse power tractor or equivalent).  It is assumed that site preparation activities occur during customary periods of such work for the local area in order to avoid saturated or ponded soils.   The presence of non-soil obstacles, e.g., slash, human-caused compacted layers from harvesting or other site activities are not considered (only natural restrictive layers are considered).  Frozen or snow-covered soils are not considered.
Soil and site properties that may impact the use machinery for surface site preparation are the depth to a shallow restrictive layer, the slope of the land surface, the stickiness of the surface soil, the rock fragment content of the surface and the rock fragment coverage of the site, and excess water.  These all impact the use and effectiveness of equipment and can impact use-dependent soil properties.

Rating Classes:

* Suited - Little or no restrictions to surface mechanical site preparation.
* Moderately suited - One or more restrictions may reduce the effective and safe use of equipment.
* Poorly Suited - One or more restrictions reduce the effective and safe use of equipment.
* Unsuited - One or more restrictions generally prevent a sufficient level of surface mechanical site preparation.

Criteria Used:

1) Restrictive Layer Limitation - Mechanical site preparation implements require a certain depth of soil in order to work properly.  The soil must be deep enough so that the machine may break up surface compaction and prepare a seedbed.  A restrictive layer may prevent the implement from performing this.  Layers that restrict root penetration may not prevent penetration by the surface preparation machinery, thus restrictive layers are differentiated on the basis of their hardness.  Layers that are indurated are likely to be impenetrable by the implement so the presence of a layer of this hardness within 30 cm of the soil surface is very limiting.  Layers that are very strongly or strongly cemented are somewhat limiting if they are present within 30 cm of the soil surface.  Noncemented limiting layers are slightly limiting if present within 30 cm of the soil surface.

A. Depth to Indurated Layer <30cm
Properties evaluated: 
DEPTH TO INDURATED LAYER (Modality - High, Low, Representative value)
Restriction limits:
		Limiting		 <= 25 cm
		Somewhat limiting	25-30 cm
		Not limiting	 >= 30 cm

Restriction limits:
		Limiting		<= 25 cm
		Somewhat limiting	25-30 cm

Restriction limits:
		Limiting		<= 25 cm
		Somewhat limiting	25-30 cm
		Not limiting	 >= 30 cm
The fuzzy number is multiplier by 0.25 to reduce the impact.

The maximum fuzzy number of rules A-C is returned as the rating for this rule.
2) Slope Limitation: Steep slopes impede trafficability of machinery and can be a safety risk.  Soil feature considered is the component slope.
		
Property used: SLOPE
		
Restriction limits:
		Limiting		> 35%
		Somewhat limiting	>= 15 and <= 35%
		Not limiting	< 15%			
		
Null Slope is assigned to the Not rated class.

3) Rock Fragments Limitation - The presence of excessive rock fragments, either contained in the soil or on the soil surface, can impede site preparation operations.  Rock fragments in the soil can reduce the efficiency of the implement.  Large fragments on the soil surface can damage the site preparation equipment and may present an obstacle to the path of the vehicle.  If the presence of rock fragments fall within the following parameters then this rule returns a value greater than 0 and rock fragments are a limiting feature.

The maximum fuzzy number of rules 3A to 3E is returned as the rating for this rule.

4) Wetness Limitation - Excessive soil moisture can seriously limit surface mechanical site preparation operations.  The soil can be too wet due to internal moisture (water table) or from ponding.  Both of these characteristics have a temporal aspect, meaning that at some time during the year, a soil that is often wet may be dry enough to work.   If the depth to a layer with wet soil moisture is =<40cm for 8 months of the year OR the soil component has frequent or occasional ponding for 8 months of the year then the rule returns a value greater than 0 and wetness is a limiting feature.

5.  Stickiness Limitation - Soils having high (>30) plasticity indices are sticky.  Soil can clog the tillage mechanisms and reduce efficiency because of the need for frequent cleaning.  If the plasticity index of a soil component is >=25 for the any layer within 30cm then this rule returns a value greater than 0 and stickiness is a limiting feature.

"TX201"|"FOR - Potential Erosion Hazard (Off-Road/Off-Trail)"|"limitation"|"Description:

Potential Erosion Hazard (Off-Road/Off-Trail) addresses the potential of harmful erosion rates due to operations that leave the mineral soil surface bare.  Ratings indicate a relative degree of the hazard or risk of soil loss from off-road and off-trail areas after disturbance activities that expose the soil surface.  The ratings assess several items, such as sheet and rill erosion from exposed soil surfaces caused by various silvicultural practices, such as grazing, mining, fire, firebreaks, and harvest.  It is assumed these activities may disturb the site resulting in 50 to 75 percent roughened bare mineral soil surface in the affected area.  The soil surface may be disturbed by the use of any equipment type or size and uncontrolled grazing by livestock.

The ratings do not take into account clean tillage and other similar activities that disturb up to nearly 100 percent of the area and change the character of the soil.  The rating is reported without regard to  individual precipitation events, so that regional climatic characteristics should be considered.  Gully erosion and its impacts are not considered.  This rule does not deal with sediment production, delivery ratio, streambank or streambed erosion for water courses on the site.   Ground disturbing activities can alter the course and amount of surface or subsurface runoff but these effects are not considered here.

Summary:

Soil interpretations for woodland management provide a means of assessing the limitations and potentials of soils for various operations.  Identification of sites that are difficult to manage will assist in the timing of the work to be done in the forest.  The characteristics of the site and soil can greatly impact the success of the woodland management in terms of efficiency and avoidance of environmental degradation.  

Soils can be a non-members, partial members or complete members of the set of soils that are limited by ""Potential Erosion Hazard (Off-Road/Off-Trail)"".  If a soil's property within 15 cm (6 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Potential Erosion Hazard (Off-Road/Off-Trail)"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through timing or management.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes indicating their degree of limitation per their rating indices.  These are slight (rating index = 0), moderate (rating index > 0 and < 0.75), severe (rating index 0.75 to 0.99) or very severe (rating index = 1).


Rating Classes:
Slight - Erosion is unlikely under ordinary climatic conditions.
Moderate - Some erosion is likely; control measures may be needed.
Severe - Erosion is very likely; control measures for vegetation re-establishment on bare areas and structural measures are advised.
Very Severe - Significant erosion is expected; loss of soil productivity and off-site damages are likely; control measures are costly and generally impractical.

Criteria Used:

1) Surface Water Erosion Hazard  In a simple sense, water erosion hazard in soils can be related to the erodibility of the soil and the degree of slope of the surface.   Erodibility is estimated by the Kw, or whole soil erodibility as is calculated based on the particle size distribution, organic matter content, structure, hydraulic conductivity, and rock fragment content of the soil layer.  The slope parameter used is the representative slope of the soil component.  The product of Kw and representative slope provides a useful metric for relative erosion hazard.  A rainfall intensity metric is provided using an indexed R value.

Property used: SLOPE X K X R FACTOR THICKEST LAYER IN DEPTH 0-15CM
Restrictive limits:
             Very severe                    (Kw)(Slope) >= 35
             Severe                             (Kw)(Slope) >=27 - <35
             Moderate                       (Kw)(Slope) >4 - < 27
             Slight                               (Kw)(Slope) <= 4

Null (Kw)(Slope)(R) is assigned to the Not rated class."|03/22/2019 19:31:08|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666488"
"TX201"|"FOR - Windthrow Hazard"|"limitation"|"FOR - Windthrow Hazard

Description:

Windfirmness is the ability of a tree to resist overturning. It is a function of the balance between the anchorage or strength of the root/soil mass and the wind drag and gravitational forces applied on the tree crown.  Windthrow is one type of wind damage and is defined as the uprooting of a tree by pivoting on the outer edge of a mass of soil, rock, and roots.   Windthrow occurs when the horizontal forces on a tree (wind drag) are transmitted down the trunk to create a torque that exceeds the resistance to turning of the root/soil system.  (Stathers, et al, 1994).  The process thus includes silvicultural, wind, tree, site, and soil variables. For example, individual tree characteristics contribute to windthrow.  Trees having large, dense canopies are more susceptible to windthrow than those having open canopies. The strength and elasticity of the bole, branches, and leaves also contribute.  The characteristics of the stand can influence the susceptibility to windthrow as well.  Stand height and stand density are also major factors, with shorter and denser stands being more resistant to windthrow than tall, open stands.  The rooting habits of the tree species impact the risk of windthrow, since deeper rooted trees are more resistant to the effects of wind than shallow rooted species (Stathers, et al, 1994).  
 
Soil and site factors are also important.  There appears to be a consensus in most windthrow studies that the soil factors that control rooting depth contribute most significantly to the risk of windthrow. Rooting depth in soil can be restricted by a variety of features.  Indurated, strongly cemented, and cemented layers such as unweathered bedrock and duripans are more or less root impenetrable.  Some noncemented layers, such as fragipans, can also curtail root penetration.  Persistent anoxic layers, such as a stagnant shallow water table can act like an impervious layer.  Wetness also has a deleterious effect on the shear strength of the soil which decreases windfirmness.  The weight of the soil over the roots adds a stabilizing anchoring influence. The shape of the land surface is also a factor in windthrow.  While the effects are complex, the trees on certain exposed portions of the landscape are more subject to high wind speeds under most circumstances.   Wind speed increases as wind streamlines are compressed by flowing through narrowing valleys, over hills and ridges, or around shoulder slopes.  Wind direction is also a factor.  In a general sense, ridgetops, shoulder slopes, and backslopes tend to increase wind speed.

This interpretation is intended to indicate those soil components on which the trees would be prone to windthrow.

Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member, or complete member of the set of soils that exhibit an intrinsic propensity for windthrow of susceptible species and specimens of trees.   If a critical soil property within 200cm of the surface or site characteristic has a membership index greater than zero, then that property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum of membership indices for one or more of the soil properties that make up the ""FOR - Windthrow Hazard"" interpretive rule.  
Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).  FOR - Windthrow Hazard is an indicator of the relative susceptibility of trees growing on a soil component to being blown over by wind.  Soil and site factors, while important, are not the only factors that need to be considered in the process of windthrow.  Silvicultural practices, tree species, and climatic variables are also involved.

Scope:

Nationwide in scope.

Criteria:

	1. Windthrow Water Table - A persistent saturated layer acts as a barrier to the growth of most plant roots and causes trees to be shallow-rooted, greatly increasing the susceptibility to windthrow.  The soil feature considered is the top depth of the first saturated layer and its temporal persistence.
Property used:  DEPTH TO WET SOIL LAYER LOG AVERAGE
Restrictive limits:
			Limiting		<= 30 cm
			Somewhat limiting	30 <= 75 cm
			Not limiting	>75 cm.
			
Null depth is assigned to the ""Not limiting"" class.
		
	2.  Windthrow Depth to Restriction -  A cemented layer, dense layer, or a low pH layer can act as a barrier to the growth of most plant roots and causes trees to be shallow-rooted, greatly increasing the susceptibility to windthrow.  The soil feature considered is the top depth of the first root restricting layer.	
	
Properties Used: DEPTH TO PH <= 3.5 BELOW AN ORGANIC LAYER
	           DPTH TO BULK DENSITY DIFFERENCE >.25 BELOW AN ORGANIC
	           DEPTH TO BEDROCK OR PAN RESTRICTIVE LAYER					
Restrictive limits:
			Limiting		<= 50cm
			Somewhat limiting	50 to <=75 cm
			Not limiting	> 75 cm.
			
			
Null depth is assigned to the ""Not limiting"" class.			
					
	3. Windthrow Hillslope Position - Backslope, shoulder, or summit hillslope profile positions are more prone to having windthrow because the wind velocity increases as it moves over these surfaces and the trees are also more likely to be exposed.
	
Property used:  TWO-DIMENSIONAL SURFACE MORPHOMETRY
		
Restrictive Limits:
			Somewhat limiting	summits, shoulders, and backslopes
			Not limiting	other geomorphic positions.
			
Null morphometry is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.

	4. Windthrow Hazard - Cindery or Pumiceous Textures Rating  Some soil materials, such as volcanic cinders and pumice have very low bulk density and thus are less able to anchor trees against the wind.

Property used:  WINDTHROW HAZARD RATING FOR PARTICLE SIZE CLASS
		
Restrictive Limits:
			Somewhat limiting	pumiceous and cindery particle size classes
			Not limiting	other particle size classes
			
Null particle size class is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.

	5. Windswept Landscape Position  Some landscapes have persistent strong winds, particularly mountain crests at high elevations.  These areas are particularly prone to windthrow.

Property used:  LOCAL PHASE
		
Restrictive Limits:
			Somewhat limiting	windswept local phase
			Not limiting	other local phases
			
Null local phase is assigned to the ""Not limited"" class.

           6. Low cohesion: Soils that have low plasticity and are fine textured have low cohesion. Soil cohesiveness is important in avoiding adverse processes such as piping and windthrow.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""SWM - Deep Infiltration Systems"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (about 79 inches) of the soil surface has a membership index greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting for the land use.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership index for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""SWM - Deep Infiltration Systems"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

SWM - Deep Infiltration Systems are a set of Best Management Practices for stormwater management.  These systems include rain gardens, bioretention basins, and infiltration basins.  These methods slow the movement of stormwater to surface waters and also filter a significant portion of pollutants from the stormwater.  The fundamental function of these systems is to hold the runoff generated from an area during a one inch rainfall event.  These systems are placed into the soil 3 to five feet, depending on the application.  There should be little or no ponding at the surface of the practice.  The water should infiltrate into the surrounding soil in 24 to 48 hours.

Scope: West Virginia and surrounding states

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  In areas underlain by carbonate bedrock, special design techniques will be needed to avoid rapid groundwater contamination and sinkhole development (Lehigh Valley Planning Commission, 2002).  

The estimated land area needed to infiltrate stormwater runoff is to be about one twentieth the size of the area producing the runoff.  The actual size will vary based on the infiltration capacity of the soil and whether of not the local bedrock is comprised largely of limestone.   

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and limit the useability of the site.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in construction, control of surface water around the practice, and may contribute to induced mass wasting from adding subsurface water to a layered soil.  Limestone bedrock is a hazard due to collapse risk and groundwater contamination hazard.

Criteria:

1. Ksat Limited: Soils that cannot transmit water rapidly enough require a larger area of land in order for the installed practice to store and infiltrate 1 inch of rain.  At some point, the soil transmits water too slowly to allow a reasonably functioniong system to be installed.


Property used: KSAT HIGHEST MINIMUM ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER 120 to 180cm DEPTH TO BEDROCK HARD  (Modality - representative value)
	
Restrictive limits:
	Severely limited		<= 3.5 um/sec
	Somewhat limited	  	 > 3.5 um/sec and < 14 um/sec
	Not limited		>= 14 um/sec
		
	Null ksat is assigned to the Not Rated class.

2. Unstable Fill:  Soils that are reconstructed because of land reclamation practices can cause differential settlement.  These areas of differential settlement are difficult to identify and are typically destructive to engineering infrastructure.  Soil feature considered is the component local phase.
	
	Property used: COMPONENT LOCAL PHASE
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting             = ""unstable fill""
		Not limiting	 not = ""unstable fill""
	
	Null local phase is assigned to the Not limiting class.

3. Hard bedrock: Soils that lack sufficient depth to hard bedrock require a larger area of land in order for the installed practice to store and infiltrate 1 inch of rain.  At some point, the soil is too shallow to allow a reasonably functioniong system to be installed.


Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK HARD  (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited	<= 120cm
		Somewhat limited  	 > 120cm and < 180cm
		Not limited		>= 180cm
		
	Null bedrock depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

4. Water table limiting:  Soils having a high seasonal water table are limited for deep infiltration systems.


Property used: DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM  (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited	<= 150 cm
		Somewhat limited  	 > 150 cm and < 200 cm
		Not limited		>= 200 cm
		
				
	Null water table depth is assigned to the Not Limited class.


5. Slope: Soils that are sloping are limited in terms of the stormwater management systems that can be installed.  Sloping soils are more difficult to for equipment usage.  excessive slope may also be a trigger for mass movement when additional water is added to a part of the landscape.  Excessive slope also requires design modifications when placing a system on a sloping landscape.  At some point, the slope is too steep to allow a reasonably functioniong system to be installed.  Some soils are more prone to slippage than others.  This is related to the amount and type of clays present in the soil.

Property used: SLOPE  (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited	>= 20 perecent
		Somewhat limited  	 > 3 percent and < 20 perecent
		Not limited		<= 3 perecent
		
	Null slope is assigned to the Not Rated class.

Property used: SLOPE and LEP (Modality - representative value)

Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited	Slope by lep factor > 20
		Somewhat limited  	Slope by lep factor > 0 to <= 20
		Not limited	Slope by lep factor = 0
		
	Null slope by lep interaction is assigned to the Not Rated class.

The sum of the fuzzy numbers is returned as the overall slope index.

6. Flooding:  Soils that are flooded are limited for stromwater management practices because they cannot function to reduce runoff if they are under flood water.


Property used: FLOODING FREQUENCY RATING (Modality reprentative value)

Restrictive Limits:

Not limited		Flooding rating <2 (none, very rare, rare)
Somewhat limited	Flooding rating 2 to 4 (occasional)
Severely limited 	Flooding rating >4 (frequent, very frequent)

Null flooding is assigned to the Not Limited class.

7. Large surface fragments:  Large fragments on the surface can impede installation of the practice and damage equipment.  Boulders (fragments greater than 600mm or 2 feet) are more limiting than stones, since they are harder to remove.

Property used: FRAGMENTS >=600MM ON SURFACE

Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited		>= 15 percent coverage
		Somewhat limited	  	> 0 to < 15 percent coverage
		Not limited			=0 percent coverage
		
		
OR

Property used: FRAGMENTS  >=250 TO 600MM ON SURFACE

Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited		>= 50 percent coverage
		Somewhat limited	  	> 15 to < 50 percent coverage
		Not limited			<= 15 percent coverage
		

		
	Null Surface fragmnents is assigned to the Not Limited class.

8. Limestone Bedrock Collapse Risk:   Addition of concentrated runoff can trigger sinkhole formation in areas of limestone bedrock.  Some limestones are more susceptible to cave ins than others.  Deeper soils on older landscapes seem to be less susceptible to sinkhole formation, but not immune.

Property used: LIMESTONE RESIDUUM (KARST LANDSCAPE LIMITATION)

Restrictive Limits:

Limiting	                If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited because of the bedrock type
Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type

9. Soft bedrock: Soils that lack sufficient depth to soft bedrock require a larger area of land in order for the installed practice to store and infiltrate 1 inch of rain.  The adsorptive capacity of the material underneath the system may also be limited.  At some point, the soil is too shallow to allow a reasonably functioniong system to be installed.



Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK SOFT  (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited	<= 120cm
		Somewhat limited  	 > 120cm and < 180cm
		Not limited		>= 180cm
		
	Null soft bedrock depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

10. Low adsorption - Soils having low adsorption lack the ability to attenuate potentially harmful material.  The volume of soil underneath the installation depth of the practice is considered.  The adsoptive capacity of the soil volume is estimated by calculating the milliequivalents of exchange capacity in a 1 centimeterx 1 centimeter x 50 centimeter volume.  The exchange is calculated from the cec at pH 7 or the ecec, depending on soil pH.


Property used: MEQ 150-200cm OR FIRST RESTRICTIVE LAYER  (Modality - representative value)
	
Restrictive limits:
	Severely limited	<= 1.0 meq/100g
	Somewhat limited  	 > 1.0 meq/100g and < 5.0 meq/100g
	Not limited		>= 5.0 meq/100g
		
	Null cec is assigned to the Not rated class.
	This subrule is weighted to 0.5, meaning it can never return a fuzzy number that exceeds 0.5.

11. Vegetation Establishment: Soil reconstruction of disturbed areas, as in excavation for a stormwater management practice, is the process of replacing layers of soil material or unconsolidated geologic material, or both, in a vertical sequence of such quality and thickness that a favorable medium for plant growth is provided.

When the soil materials are properly used in reconstruction, a rating of good means that vegetation is relatively easy to establish and maintain, that the surface is stable and resists erosion, and that the reconstructed soil has good potential productivity.  Material rated fair can be vegetated and stabilized by modifying one or more properties.  Topdressing with better material or applications of soil amendments may be necessary for satisfactory performance.  Material rated poor has such severe problems that revegetation and stabilization are very difficult and costly.  Topdressing with better material is necessary to establish and maintain vegetation.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of reconstruction material.  The soil interpretation for reconstruction material source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Vegetation is difficult to establish on soils that have high pH.  Many of these soils also have a high sodium adsorption ratio, which indicates potential instability and water transmission problems.  Materials that are extremely acid or have the potential upon oxidation of becoming extremely acid are difficult and expensive to vegetate.  They also contribute to poor water quality, in runoff or in ground water.

The available water capacity also is important in establishing vegetation.  Soils that have a low available water capacity may require irrigation for the establishment of vegetation.

The stability of the soil depends upon its erodibility by water and wind and its strength.  Water erodibility is indicated by the K factor; wind erodibility is rated according to the ""I"" value of the wind erodibility group.  Potential slippage hazard is related to soil texture, and although other factors also contribute, the ratings of soil texture represent one important factor.

The fraction 3-10 inches is a weight percentage of rock fragments in the material used for soil reconstruction.  The amount and size of rock fragments influence the ease of excavation, stockpiling, and respreading and the suitability for the final use of the land.  A certain amount of rock fragments can be tolerated depending upon their size and the intended use of the reclaimed area.  If the size of rock fragments exceeds 10 inches, problems are more severe.

12. Limestone Bedrock Groundwater Contamination Risk: Limestone bedrock may have numerous solution channels that allow contaminants to enter the groundwater quickly and with little renovation.    

Property used: LIMESTONE BEDROCK

"TX201"|"ENG - Ground-based Solar Arrays, Ballast Anchor Systems"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Ground-based solar arrays are sets of photovoltaic panels that are not situated on a building or pole.  These installations consist of a racking system that holds the panel in the desired orientation and the foundation structures that hold the racking system to the ground.  Two basic methods are used to hold the systems to the ground, based on site conditions and cost.  One method employs driven piles, screw augers, or concrete piers that penetrate into the soil to provide a stable foundation. The ease of installation and general site suitability of soil-penetrating anchoring systems depends on soil characteristics such as rock fragment content, soil depth, soil strength, soil corrosivity, shrink-swell tendencies, and drainage.  The other basic anchoring system utilizes precast ballasted footings or ballasted trays on the soil surface to make the arrays too heavy to move.  The site considerations that impact both basic systems are slope, slope aspect, wind speed, land surface shape, flooding, and ponding.  Other factors that will contribute to the function of a solar power array include daily hours of sunlight and shading from hills, trees, or buildings.

Ballast anchor systems can be used in some places where soil-penetrating systems cannot, such as in shallow or stony soil.  Also, since they do not penetrate the soil, ballast systems can be used where the soil is contaminated and disturbance is to be avoided.  The soil in the area must have sufficient strength to be able to support the vehicles that haul the ballast and the machinery to install it.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Ground-based Solar Panel Arrays"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Ground-based Solar Panel Arrays"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:


Scope: National


Criteria:



1. Ponding: Ponding is the condition where standing water is on the soil surface for a given period of time.  Soils that pond have restrictions that limit the installation and function of most land use applications.  Soil features considered are ponding duration and frequency classes for all months.

	Property used: PONDING DURATION (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		= ""very brief"" or ""brief"" or ""long"" or ""very long""
		Not limiting	not = ""very brief"" or ""brief"" or ""long"" or ""very long""
		
	Null duration is assigned to the Not limiting class.
OR
		
	Property used: PONDING FREQUENCY
			(Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

		Limiting	                    not = ""none""
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class. 


 
2.  Slope: Steep slopes impede trafficability of heavy machinery and reclamation of borrow sites. Some slope may be beneficial to the solar panel array because the rows could be closer together if the slope aspect is to the south.  Areas that are too steep make installation more difficult and are harder to maintain.  Soil feature considered is the component slope.
		
	Property used: SLOPE (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		> 15%
		Somewhat limiting	>= 8 and <= 15%
		Not limiting		< 8%			
		
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.

3.  Depth to saturated zone: Soils with shallow depth to a water table may become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation and are slow to drain.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month.

	Property used: HIGH WATER TABLE DEPTH MINIMUM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=< 30cm
		Somewhat limiting	 > 30 to < 75cm
		Not limiting		=> 75cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.



4. Shrink-swell:  Excessive shrink-swell in the depth between 25 and 100cm deep can cause structure foundations to shift and stresses to be placed on the solar panel racks.  Th soil feature considered is weighted average of percent linear extensibility of the horizons between a depth of 10 to 40 inches or above bedrock.

	Property used: SHRINK-SWELL THICKEST LAYER 25-100cm OR ABOVE ROCK (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
			
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 > 6%
		Somewhat limiting	=> 3% to <= 6%
		Not limiting	 < 3%
		
	Null linear extensibility is assigned to the Not limiting class.

	Property used: POTENTIAL FROST ACTION (Modality - representative value)
			
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting 	 	= ""high""  
		Somewhat Limiting 	= ""moderate""
		Not limiting	all others
		
	Null frost action values are assigned to the Not limiting class.

6.  Hillslope Position:  Certain positions on the landscape are more susceptible to higher wind pressures than others.  Convex areas, particularly at or near the crests of hills and ridges are most strongly affected because the venturi effect as wind goes over the top of a hill.


                Property used: TWO-DIMENSIONAL SURFACE MORPHOMETRY (Modality - representative value)
			
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting 	 	= not used  
		Somewhat Limiting 	= ""summit"" or ""shoulder""
		Not limiting	all others
		
	Null hillslope position values are assigned to the Not Rated class.

7.  Slope shape:  The shape of the land surface affects the installation of solar panel arrays, with more planar surfaces being the easiest and least expensive to use.  The radius of curavture is also important.  Sites that are convex or concave across the slope become increasingly more difficult to place panels on as the radius of curvature becomes less.

                Property used:  SLOPE SHAPE ACROSS SLOPE (Modality - representative value)
			
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting 	 	= not used  
		Somewhat Limiting 	= ""concave"" or ""convex""
		Not limiting	= ""linear""

Null hillslope shape values are assigned to the Not Rated class.


8.  Aspect and slope: The direction the slope is facing, or the slope aspect, is very important for solar panel arrays.  South facing slopes are desirable while north facing slopes are not desirable, especially if the slope gradient is more that 12 percent.

Properties used: ASPECT (REPRESENTATIVE) / default (modality representative value)

Restriction limits:

                       Not limiting                     180 degrees
                       Somewhat limiting          > 180 to 359 degrees, >0 to 179 degrees
                       Limiting                           0 degrees

Null aspect is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

                             SLOPE (modality high, low,  representative value)

                  Restriction limits:

                       Not limiting                     <5 percent
                       Somewhat limiting          5 to 12 percent
                       Limiting                           >12 percent

Null slope is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

The resultant fuzzy numbers are multiplied together to denote the interaction of slope and aspect.

7.  Depth to saturated zone: Soils with shallow depth to a water table may become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation and are slow to drain.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month.

	Property used: HIGH WATER TABLE DEPTH MINIMUM (Modality - representative value)

		Not limiting		=> 75cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.


8.  Steel corrosion:  Under certain soil conditions, electromotive cells can be set up that cause uncoated steel to react with the surrounding soil.  Anything that can cause a potential difference can cause accelerated corrosion, but the main variables are soil resistivity, pH, sulfates, and watertables.  Special attention must be given to those soil properties that affect the access of oxygen and moisture to the metal, the electrolyte, the chemical reaction in the electrolyte, and the flow of current through the electrolyte. Special attention must be given to the presence of sulfides or of minerals, such as pyrite, that can be weathered readily and thus cause a high degree of corrosion in metals.  The possibility of corrosion is greater for extensive installations that intersect soil boundaries or soil horizons than for installations that are in one kind of soil or in one soil horizon.

		Somewhat limiting	= ""moderate""
		Not limiting	= ""low""			
		
	Null corrosion is assigned Not rated.

9. Shrink-swell:  Excessive shrink-swell in the depth between 25 and 100cm deep can cause structure foundations to shift and stresses to be placed on the solar panel racks.  The soil feature considered is weighted average of percent linear extensibility of the horizons between a depth of 10 to 40 inches or above bedrock.

	Property used: SHRINK-SWELL THICKEST LAYER 25-100cm OR ABOVE ROCK (Modality - high, low, and representative value)

		Somewhat limiting	=> 3% to <= 6%
		Not limiting	 < 3%
		
	Null linear extensibility is assigned to the Not limiting class.

		Somewhat Limiting 	= ""moderate""
		Not limiting	all others
		
	Null frost action values are assigned to the Not limiting class.

11.  Hillslope Position:  Certain positions on the landscape are more susceptible to higher wind pressures than others.  Convex areas, particularly at or near the crests of hills and ridges are most strongly affected because the venturi effect as wind goes over the top of a hill.


                Property used: TWO-DIMENSIONAL SURFACE MORPHOMETRY (Modality - representative value)
			
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting 	 	= not used  
		Somewhat Limiting 	= ""summit"" or ""shoulder""
		Not limiting	all others
		
	Null hillslope position values are assigned to the Not Rated class.

12.  Slope shape:  The shape of the land surface affects the installation of solar panel arrays, with more planar surfaces being the easiest and least expensive to use.  The radius of curavture is also important.  Sites that are convex or concave across the slope become increasingly more difficult to place panels on as the radius of curvature becomes less.

                Property used:  SLOPE SHAPE ACROSS SLOPE (Modality - representative value)
			
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting 	 	= not used  
		Somewhat Limiting 	= ""concave"" or ""convex""
		Not limiting	= ""linear""

Null hillslope shape values are assigned to the Not Rated class.


13.  Aspect and slope: The direction the slope is facing, or the slope aspect, is very important for solar panel arrays.  South facing slopes are desirable while north facing slopes are not desirable, especially if the slope gradient is more that 12 percent.

Properties used: ASPECT (REPRESENTATIVE) / default (modality representative value)

Restriction limits:

                       Not limiting                     180 degrees
                       Somewhat limiting          > 180 to 359 degrees, >0 to 179 degrees
                       Limiting                           0 degrees

Null aspect is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

                             SLOPE (modality high, low,  representative value)

                  Restriction limits:

                       Not limiting                     <5 percent
                       Somewhat limiting          5 to 12 percent
                       Limiting                           >12 percent

Null slope is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

The resultant fuzzy numbers are multiplied together to denote the interaction of slope and aspect.

14.  Low strength: Soils with high AASHTO Group Index have low strength which affects the soil's traffic-supporting capacity.  This condition is only partially restrictive when clay mineralogy is kaolinitic.  Soil feature considered is the AASHTO Group Index of the thickest soil layer between 25 and 100cm or above a cemented restrictive layer and taxonomic family mineralogy.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""SWM - Lined Retention Systems"".  If a soil property within 200 cm (about 79 inches) of the soil surface has a membership index greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting for the land use.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership index for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""SWM - Lined Retention Systems"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

SWM -Lined Retention Systems are a set of Best Management Practices for stormwater management.  These systems include retention basins and intermittent wetlands.  These methods slow the movement of stormwater to surface waters and also filter a significant portion of pollutants from the stormwater.  The fundamental function of these systems is to hold the runoff generated from an area during a one inch rainfall event.  These systems are placed into the soil 3 to five feet, depending on the application.  There should be little or no ponding at the surface of the practice.  The water should infiltrate into the surrounding soil in 24 to 48 hours. This particular practice includes a rubber liner to slow or stop the flow of water into the subsoil.  Thus, this system can be used on soils where the water table is deep, intermittent, or absent.

Scope: West Virginia and surrounding states

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  In areas underlain by carbonate bedrock, special design techniques will be needed to avoid rapid groundwater contamination and sinkhole development (Lehigh Valley Planning Commission, 2002).  

The estimated land area needed to infiltrate stormwater runoff is to be about one twentieth the size of the area producing the runoff.  The actual size will vary based on the infiltration capacity of the soil and whether of not the local bedrock is comprised largely of limestone.   

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and limit the useability of the site.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in construction, control of surface water around the practice, and may contribute to induced mass wasting from adding subsurface water to a layered soil.

Criteria:

1. Ksat Limited: Soils that transmit water too rapidly cannot maintain a saturatred zone for wetland vegetation.  At some point, the soil transmits water too rapidly to allow a reasonably functioning system to be installed.


Property used: KSAT HIGHEST MIN ABOVE RESTRICTION, BELOW O, 120 TO 200 CM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Not limited			<= 3.5 um/sec
		Somewhat limited	  	> 3.5 um/sec and < 14 um/sec
		Severely limited		>= 14 um/sec
		
	Null ksat is assigned to the Not Rated class.

2. Unstable Fill:  Soils that are reconstructed because of land reclamation practices can cause differential 
settlement.  These areas of differential settlement are difficult to identify and are typically destructive to 
engineering infrastructure.  Soil feature considered is the component local phase.
	
	Property used: COMPONENT LOCAL PHASE
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting             = ""unstable fill""
		Not limiting	 not = ""unstable fill""
	
	Null local phase is assigned to the Not limiting class.

3. Hard bedrock: Soils that lack sufficient depth to hard bedrock require a larger area of land in order for the 
installed practice to store and infiltrate 1 inch of rain.  At some point, the soil is too shallow to allow a 
reasonably functioniong system to be installed.


Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK HARD  (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited	<= 120cm
		Somewhat limited  	 > 120cm and < 180cm
		Not limited		>= 180cm
		
	Null bedrock depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

4. Water table limiting:  Soils lacking a high seasonal water table are limited for retention systems.  The wetland vegetation requires groundwater be available to the plant roots to maintain growth but not have free water at the surface for long periods during the warm season in order to reduce insect pest populations.  


Property used: WATER TABLE DEPTH DURING GROWING SEASON  (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Not limited		<= 60 cm
		Somewhat limited  	> 60 cm and < 180 cm
		Severely limited	>= 180 cm
		
				
	Null water table depth is assigned to the Severely Limited class.

5. Slope: Soils that are sloping are limited in terms of the stormwater management systems that can be installed.  
Sloping soils are more difficult to for equipment usage.  excessive slope may also be a trigger for mass movement 
when additional water is added to a part of the landscape.  Excessive slope also requires design modifications when 
placing a system on a sloping landscape.  At some point, the slope is too steep to allow a reasonably functioniong 
system to be installed.  Some soils are more prone to slippage than others.  This is related to the amount and type 
of clays present in the soil.

Property used: SLOPE  (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited	>= 20 perecent
		Somewhat limited  	 > 3 percent and < 20 perecent
		Not limited		<= 3 perecent
		
	Null slope is assigned to the Not Rated class.

Property used: SLOPE and LEP (Modality - representative value)

Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited	Slope by lep factor > 20
		Somewhat limited  	Slope by lep factor > 0 to <= 20
		Not limited	Slope by lep factor = 0
		
	Null slope by lep interaction is assigned to the Not Rated class.

The sum of the fuzzy numbers is returned as the overall slope index.

6. Flooding:  Soils that are flooded are limited for stromwater management practices because they cannot function to 
reduce runoff if they are under flood water.


Property used: FLOODING FREQUENCY RATING (Modality reprentative value)

Restrictive Limits:

Not limited		Flooding rating <2 (none, very rare, rare)
Somewhat limited	Flooding rating 2 to 4 (occasional)
Severely limited 	Flooding rating >4 (frequent, very frequent)

Null flooding is assigned to the Not Limited class.

7. Large surface fragments:  Large fragments on the surface can impede installation of the practice and damage 
equipment.  Boulders (fragments greater than 600mm or 2 feet) are more limiting than stones, since they are harder to 
remove.

Property used: FRAGMENTS >=600MM ON SURFACE

Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited		>= 15 percent coverage
		Somewhat limited	  	> 0 to < 15 percent coverage
		Not limited			=0 percent coverage
		
		
OR

Property used: FRAGMENTS  >=250 TO 600MM ON SURFACE

Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited		>= 50 percent coverage
		Somewhat limited	  	> 15 to < 50 percent coverage
		Not limited			<= 15 percent coverage
		

		
	Null Surface fragmnents is assigned to the Not Limited class.

8. Limestone Bedrock Collapse Risk:   Addition of concentrated runoff can trigger sinkhole formation in areas of 
limestone bedrock.  Some limestones are more susceptible to cave ins than others.  Deeper soils on older landscapes 
seem to be less susceptible to sinkhole formation, but not immune.

Property used: LIMESTONE RESIDUUM (KARST LANDSCAPE LIMITATION)

Restrictive Limits:

Limiting	                If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited because of the bedrock type
Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type

9. Soft bedrock:  Soils having soft bedrock too close to the surface are limited for retention systems.  For a reasonable system enough volume of water must be retained.  The soft bedrock limits excavation and can be too pervious.




Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK SOFT  (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited	<= 100cm
		Somewhat limited  	 > 100cm and < 180cm
		Not limited		>= 180cm
		
	Null soft bedrock depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

10. Vegetation Establishment: Soil reconstruction of disturbed areas, as in excavation for a stormwater management 
practice, is the process of replacing layers of soil material or unconsolidated geologic material, or both, in a 
vertical sequence of such quality and thickness that a favorable medium for plant growth is provided.

When the soil materials are properly used in reconstruction, a rating of good means that vegetation is relatively 
easy to establish and maintain, that the surface is stable and resists erosion, and that the reconstructed soil has 
good potential productivity.  Material rated fair can be vegetated and stabilized by modifying one or more 
properties.  Topdressing with better material or applications of soil amendments may be necessary for satisfactory 
performance.  Material rated poor has such severe problems that revegetation and stabilization are very difficult and 
costly.  Topdressing with better material is necessary to establish and maintain vegetation.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of reconstruction material.  The soil 
interpretation for reconstruction material source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the 
soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider 
present land use.

Vegetation is difficult to establish on soils that have high pH.  Many of these soils also have a high sodium 
adsorption ratio, which indicates potential instability and water transmission problems.  Materials that are 
extremely acid or have the potential upon oxidation of becoming extremely acid are difficult and expensive to 
vegetate.  They also contribute to poor water quality, in runoff or in ground water.

The available water capacity also is important in establishing vegetation.  Soils that have a low available water 
capacity may require irrigation for the establishment of vegetation.

The stability of the soil depends upon its erodibility by water and wind and its strength.  Water erodibility is 
indicated by the K factor; wind erodibility is rated according to the ""I"" value of the wind erodibility group.  
Potential slippage hazard is related to soil texture, and although other factors also contribute, the ratings of soil 
texture represent one important factor.

The fraction 3-10 inches is a weight percentage of rock fragments in the material used for soil reconstruction.  The 
amount and size of rock fragments influence the ease of excavation, stockpiling, and respreading and the suitability 
for the final use of the land.  A certain amount of rock fragments can be tolerated depending upon their size and the 
intended use of the reclaimed area.  If the size of rock fragments exceeds 10 inches, problems are more severe.

11. Water Spreading Surface: Some surfaces are shaped so as to spread water.  Soils that are concave up and down their slope and concave across their slope are the least water spreading.  Soils that are concave across their slope and linear or convex up and down their slopes are less water collecting.  Soils that are linear across their slopes and concave up and down their slopes are somewhat water collecting.  Soils that are convex up and down their slopes and convex across their slopes are the most water spreading.

Water spreading (convex) surfaces can diffuse water flow and cause increased costs because of materials and land shaping may be needed to direct the water flow into the practice.
		  
		  Property Used: WATER GATHERING SURFACE
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		    Somewhat Limiting	Convex up-down, convex across surfaces
		    Slightly limiting		Convex across, linear or concave up-down
		    Not limiting		All other surface shapes
		    
		  NOTE!!!  The fuzzy number returned by this rule can not exceed 0.5.
		  
Null slope shape is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

12. Limestone Bedrock Groundwater Contamination Risk: Limestone bedrock may have numerous solution channels that 
allow contaminants to enter the groundwater quickly and with little renovation.    

Property used: LIMESTONE BEDROCK

Restrictive Limits:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""SWM - Shallow Infiltration Systems"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (about 79 inches) of the soil surface has a membership index greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting for the land use.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership index for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""SWM - Shallow Infiltration Systems"" interpretive rule.

Description:

SWM - Shallow Infiltration Systems are a set of Best Management Practices for stormwater management.  These systems include pervious pavement, buffer strips, filter strips, and vegetated swales.  These methods slow the movement of stormwater to surface waters and also filter a significant portion of pollutants from the stormwater.  The fundamental function of these systems is to hold the runoff generated from an area during a one inch rainfall event.  These systems are placed into the soil one to 3 feet, depending on the application.  There should be little or no ponding at the surface of the practice.  The water should infiltrate into the surrounding soil in 24 to 48 hours.

9. Soft bedrock: Soils that lack sufficient depth to soft bedrock require a larger area of land in order for the installed practice to store and infiltrate 1 inch of rain.

properties.  Topdressing with better material or applications of soil amendments may be necessary for satisfactory 
performance.  Material rated poor has such severe problems that revegetation and stabilization are very difficult and 
costly.  Topdressing with better material is necessary to establish and maintain vegetation.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of reconstruction material.  The soil 
interpretation for reconstruction material source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the 
soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider 
present land use.

Vegetation is difficult to establish on soils that have high pH.  Many of these soils also have a high sodium 
adsorption ratio, which indicates potential instability and water transmission problems.  Materials that are 
extremely acid or have the potential upon oxidation of becoming extremely acid are difficult and expensive to 
vegetate.  They also contribute to poor water quality, in runoff or in ground water.

The available water capacity also is important in establishing vegetation.  Soils that have a low available water 
capacity may require irrigation for the establishment of vegetation.

The stability of the soil depends upon its erodibility by water and wind and its strength.  Water erodibility is 
indicated by the K factor; wind erodibility is rated according to the ""I"" value of the wind erodibility group.  
Potential slippage hazard is related to soil texture, and although other factors also contribute, the ratings of soil 
texture represent one important factor.

The fraction 3-10 inches is a weight percentage of rock fragments in the material used for soil reconstruction.  The 
amount and size of rock fragments influence the ease of excavation, stockpiling, and respreading and the suitability 
for the final use of the land.  A certain amount of rock fragments can be tolerated depending upon their size and the 
intended use of the reclaimed area.  If the size of rock fragments exceeds 10 inches, problems are more severe.

12. Limestone Bedrock Groundwater Contamination Risk: Limestone bedrock may have numerous solution channels that 
allow contaminants to enter the groundwater quickly and with little renovation.    

Property used: LIMESTONE BEDROCK

Restrictive Limits:

Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type"|07/19/2018 19:46:25|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666475"
"TX201"|"ENG - Unlined Retention Systems"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""SWM - Unlined Retention Systems"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (about 79 inches) of the soil surface has a membership index greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting for the land use.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership index for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""SWM - Unlined Retention Systems"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

SWM - Unlined Retention Systems are a set of Best Management Practices for stormwater management.  These systems include retention basins and intermittent wetlands.  These methods slow the movement of stormwater to surface waters and also filter a significant portion of pollutants from the stormwater.  The fundamental function of these systems is to hold the runoff generated from an area during a one inch rainfall event.  These systems are placed into the soil 3 to five feet, depending on the application.  There should be little or no ponding at the surface of the practice.  The water should infiltrate into the surrounding soil in 24 to 48 hours.

Scope: West Virginia and surrounding states

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  In areas underlain by carbonate bedrock, special design techniques will be needed to avoid rapid groundwater contamination and sinkhole development (Lehigh Valley Planning Commission, 2002).  

The estimated land area needed to infiltrate stormwater runoff is to be about one twentieth the size of the area producing the runoff.  The actual size will vary based on the infiltration capacity of the soil and whether of not the local bedrock is comprised largely of limestone.   

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and limit the useability of the site.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in construction, control of surface water around the practice, and may contribute to induced mass wasting from adding subsurface water to a layered soil.

Criteria:

1. Ksat Limited: Soils that transmit water too rapidly cannot maintain a saturatred zone for wetland vegetation.  At some point, the soil transmits water too rapidly to allow a reasonably functioniong system to be installed.


Property used: KSAT HIGHEST MIN ABOVE RESTRICTION, BELOW O, 120 TO 200 CM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Not limited			<= 3.5 um/sec
		Somewhat limited	  	> 3.5 um/sec and < 14 um/sec
		Severely limited		>= 14 um/sec
		
	Null ksat is assigned to the Not Rated class.

2. Unstable Fill:  Soils that are reconstructed because of land reclamation practices can cause differential 
settlement.  These areas of differential settlement are difficult to identify and are typically destructive to 
engineering infrastructure.  Soil feature considered is the component local phase.
	
	Property used: COMPONENT LOCAL PHASE
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting             = ""unstable fill""
		Not limiting	 not = ""unstable fill""
	
	Null local phase is assigned to the Not limiting class.

3. Hard bedrock: Soils that lack sufficient depth to hard bedrock require a larger area of land in order for the installed practice to store and infiltrate 1 inch of rain.  At some point, the soil is too shallow to allow a reasonably functioniong system to be installed.

DEPTH TO BEDROCK HARD

Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK HARD  (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited	<= 60cm
		Somewhat limited  	 > 60cm and < 120cm
		Not limited		>= 120cm
		
	Null bedrock depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

4. Water table limiting:  Soils lacking a high seasonal water table are limited for retention systems.  The wetland vegetation requires groundwater be available to the plant roots to maintain growth but not have free water at the surface for long periods during the warm season in order to reduce insect pest populations.  


Property used: WATER TABLE DEPTH DURING GROWING SEASON  (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Not limited		<= 60 cm
		Somewhat limited  	> 60 cm and < 180 cm
		Severely limited	>= 180 cm
		
				
	Null water table depth is assigned to the Severely Limited class.

5. Slope: Soils that are sloping are limited in terms of the stormwater management systems that can be installed.  
Sloping soils are more difficult to for equipment usage.  excessive slope may also be a trigger for mass movement 
when additional water is added to a part of the landscape.  Excessive slope also requires design modifications when 
placing a system on a sloping landscape.  At some point, the slope is too steep to allow a reasonably functioniong 
system to be installed.  Some soils are more prone to slippage than others.  This is related to the amount and type 
of clays present in the soil.

Property used: SLOPE  (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited	>= 10 perecent
		Somewhat limited  	 > 3 percent and < 10 perecent
		Not limited		<= 3 perecent
		
	Null slope is assigned to the Not Rated class.

Property used: SLOPE and LEP (Modality - representative value)

Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited	Slope by lep factor > 20
		Somewhat limited  	Slope by lep factor > 0 to <= 20
		Not limited	Slope by lep factor = 0
		
	Null slope by lep interaction is assigned to the Not Rated class.

The sum of the fuzzy numbers is returned as the overall slope index.

6.  Flooding:  Soils that are flooded are limited for stromwater management practices because they cannot function to 
reduce runoff if they are under flood water.


Property used: FLOODING FREQUENCY RATING (Modality reprentative value)

Restrictive Limits:

Not limited		Flooding rating <2 (none, very rare, rare)
Somewhat limited	Flooding rating 2 to 4 (occasional)
Severely limited 	Flooding rating >4 (frequent, very frequent)

Null flooding is assigned to the Not Limited class.

7. Large surface fragments:  Large fragments on the surface can impede installation of the practice and damage 
equipment.  Boulders (fragments greater than 600mm or 2 feet) are more limiting than stones, since they are harder to 
remove.

Property used: FRAGMENTS >=600MM ON SURFACE

Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited		>= 15 percent coverage
		Somewhat limited	  	> 0 to < 15 percent coverage
		Not limited			=0 percent coverage
		
		
OR

Property used: FRAGMENTS  >=250 TO 600MM ON SURFACE

Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited		>= 50 percent coverage
		Somewhat limited	  	> 15 to < 50 percent coverage
		Not limited			<= 15 percent coverage
		

		
	Null Surface fragmnents is assigned to the Not Limited class.

8. Limestone Bedrock Collapse Risk:   Addition of concentrated runoff can trigger sinkhole formation in areas of 
limestone bedrock.  Some limestones are more susceptible to cave ins than others.  Deeper soils on older landscapes 
seem to be less susceptible to sinkhole formation, but not immune.

Property used: LIMESTONE RESIDUUM (KARST LANDSCAPE LIMITATION)

Restrictive Limits:

Limiting	                If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited because of the bedrock type
Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type

9. Soft bedrock:  Soils having soft bedrock too close to the surface are limited for retention systems.  For a reasonable system enough volume of water must be retained.  The soft bedrock limits excavation and can be too pervious.




Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK SOFT  (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Severely limited	<= 100cm
		Somewhat limited  	 > 100cm and < 180cm
		Not limited		>= 180cm
		
	Null soft bedrock depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

10. Vegetation Establishment: Soil reconstruction of disturbed areas, as in excavation for a stormwater management 
practice, is the process of replacing layers of soil material or unconsolidated geologic material, or both, in a 
vertical sequence of such quality and thickness that a favorable medium for plant growth is provided.

When the soil materials are properly used in reconstruction, a rating of good means that vegetation is relatively 
easy to establish and maintain, that the surface is stable and resists erosion, and that the reconstructed soil has 
good potential productivity.  Material rated fair can be vegetated and stabilized by modifying one or more 
properties.  Topdressing with better material or applications of soil amendments may be necessary for satisfactory 
performance.  Material rated poor has such severe problems that revegetation and stabilization are very difficult and 
costly.  Topdressing with better material is necessary to establish and maintain vegetation.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of reconstruction material.  The soil 
interpretation for reconstruction material source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the 
soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider 
present land use.

Vegetation is difficult to establish on soils that have high pH.  Many of these soils also have a high sodium 
adsorption ratio, which indicates potential instability and water transmission problems.  Materials that are 
extremely acid or have the potential upon oxidation of becoming extremely acid are difficult and expensive to 
vegetate.  They also contribute to poor water quality, in runoff or in ground water.

The available water capacity also is important in establishing vegetation.  Soils that have a low available water 
capacity may require irrigation for the establishment of vegetation.

The stability of the soil depends upon its erodibility by water and wind and its strength.  Water erodibility is 
indicated by the K factor; wind erodibility is rated according to the ""I"" value of the wind erodibility group.  
Potential slippage hazard is related to soil texture, and although other factors also contribute, the ratings of soil 
texture represent one important factor.

The fraction 3-10 inches is a weight percentage of rock fragments in the material used for soil reconstruction.  The 
amount and size of rock fragments influence the ease of excavation, stockpiling, and respreading and the suitability 
for the final use of the land.  A certain amount of rock fragments can be tolerated depending upon their size and the 
intended use of the reclaimed area.  If the size of rock fragments exceeds 10 inches, problems are more severe.

11. Limestone Bedrock Groundwater Contamination Risk: Limestone bedrock may have numerous solution channels that 
allow contaminants to enter the groundwater quickly and with little renovation.    

Property used: LIMESTONE BEDROCK

Restrictive Limits:

Limiting	                If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited because of the bedrock type
Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type

12. Water table limiting:  Soils having a  high seasonal water table may be limited in terms of the time that a retention system can be installed.  The soil wetness reduces bearing strength and causes other problems with machinery as well as increasing soil compaction.  This is further limited by the consideration that installation is likely to occur only during the growing season when vegetation can be more readily established.  This rule examines the water table depth and duration within the growing season.


Property used: WATER TABLE DEPTH DURING GROWING SEASON  (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Not limited		>= 150 cm
		Somewhat limited  	> 45 cm and < 150 cm
		Severely limited	< 45 cm
		
				
	Null water table depth is assigned to the not limited class.

Property used: WET SOIL MONTHS DURING GROWING SEASON - COUNT  (Modality - representative value)

Restrictive limits:
		Not limited		0 months
		Somewhat limited  	>0 but less than 12 months
		Severely limited	12 months

Null months of saturation is assigned to the not limited class.

Soil is the habitat for a wide variety of organisms, ranging from viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes and a variety of others.  Bacteria and fungi provide many services in soils.  For example, bacteria convert plant and animal tissues into humus.  Many of the resultant compounds bind the soil into aggregates.  Bacteria may fix nitrogen for plant use and fungi assist plant roots in obtaining nutrients and water.  Soil microbes are generally most abundant in the surface layer since they typically are found around plant roots.  Soils vary in their ability to foster plant growth and thus also in their ability to support microbial populations.  These differences can be caused by natural, inherent soil and site properties or can be the result of dynamic soil properties that are influenced by management, good or bad.  Two major classifications of soil organisms are aerobic and anaerobic, which deal with electron flow in the metabolic processes in the presence or absence of oxygen.

Several site and soil properties are major attributes in the suitability, in terms of survival and growth rates, of soil for various organisms.  On a broad scale, trends in temperature (heat) and precipitation (water) govern the rates of respiration since biologic processes are temperature dependent and soil organisms exist in films of water.  The organic matter content of the soil is always a major factor in microbial populations since they are typically saprophytic.  The pore space in the soil influences water and gas movement as well as the volume for organisms to occupy and the tortuosity of paths through which they may move.  The water content of the soil is important as when too much water is present anaerobic processes begin and when too little is present the organisms may go dormant.  Osmotic conditions are also important, as are the presence of toxic materials or the absence of required elements.

Criteria

1.  The pH of the soil at 30cm is used as an indicator of how conducive the soil is to the growth of soil organisms.  Soil solution pH impacts several processes in soil.  The solubility of potentially toxic elements in soils is pH dependent and may impact the vigor and diversity of microbial populations.

Property used:  WTD_AVG PH 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION 
Interpretive thresholds:
              limiting to the growth of soil organisms            pH <5.0	 
              not limiting to the growth of soil organisms      pH 5.0-8.0
              limiting to the growth of soil organisms            pH >8.0	
	
	Null pH is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

2.  Mean annual air temperature  While soil temperature is the best metric for assessing the amount of heat available for the growth of soil organisms, mean annual air temperature is used as a proxy.  It is understood that the mean annual soil temperature will be several degrees higher.  Also, it is understood that the temperature that the organisms are dealing with may be much higher or lower than the mean.

Property used:  MEAN ANNUAL AIR TEMPERATURE
Interpretive thresholds:
	limited		MAAT less than 1C or greater than 50C 
	somewhat limited     MAAT between 0 and 15 or MAAT between 24 and 50C
	not limited	MAAT between 15 and 24C
	
	Null mean annual air temperature is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

3.  Moisture relations  The spatial and temporal distribution of water in soil is governed mainly by three relationships.  One relationship is the basic difference between the amount of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration a soil experiences.  More precipitation is needed for soil organisms to thrive in warmer climates, or, conversely, less precipitation is needed in cooler climates.  Another feature that can influence the water content of soil is the presence of a water table (a zone of saturation) that can either drown organisms if it is too shallow or provide subirrigation if the water is in a depth where the organisms can use it.  Finally, precipitation that a soil does receive must not be allowed to rapidly move through the soil, but rather be stored.

A.  Property used:  PRECIPITATION MINUS POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION, MM/YEAR
Interpretive thresholds:
              limited to the growth of soil organisms              less than -100mm/yr MAP-PET
              somewhat limited to the growth of soil organisms   -100 to 100 mm/yr MAP-PET
              not limited to the growth of soil organisms                  greater than 100mm/yr MAP-PET
	
	Null MAP or PET is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

B.  Property used:  WATER TABLE DEPTH, GROWING SEASON

Interpretive thresholds:
          limiting to the growth of soil organisms                     saturated at surface or greater than 200cm
          somewhat limiting to the growth of soil organisms   saturation between 0 and 30cm or 50 to 200cm
          not limiting to the growth of soil organisms              saturation 30 and 50cm
	
	Null water table depth is assigned to the poorly suited class.

C.  Property used:  AWC 0-150cm OR FIRST ROOT RESTRICTIVE LAYER
Interpretive thresholds:
          limiting to the growth of soil organisms                     AWC of 0cm
          somewhat limiting to the growth of soil organisms    AWC between 0 and 30cm 
          not limiting to the growth of soil organisms               AWC greater 300cm
	
	Null AWC is assigned to the not rated class.

4.  Electrical conductivity  The electrical conductivity of soil is a measure of the amount of cations available in soil solution.  These cations are present in the soil solution.  In regions that receive less precipitation than evapotranspiration, these ions can accumulate to the point where they saturate the exchange complex and become concentrated enough to seriously impact the osmotic relations of organisms.  In highly leached systems, the concentration of basic cations mat be too low to support thriving populations of soil organisms.

Property used:  BULK EC 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION

Interpretive thresholds:
     limiting                    EC less than 0.3 or greater than 10 dS/m 
     somewhat limiting   EC between 0.3 and 0.75 or between 1.5 and 10 dS/m
     not limiting              EC between 0.75 and 1.5 dS/m
	
	Null EC is assigned to the not rated class.

5.  Aluminum saturation  In highly acidic soils, aluminum species can become the dominant cation in soil solution.  In high concentrations, aluminum can be toxic to soil microorganisms.  Aluminum can become the dominant cation on the exchange complex and can even come to saturate the CEC of some soils.

Property used:  ALUMINIUM SATURATION WTD AVE TO 30CM

Interpretive thresholds:
      limiting                       Aluminum saturation above 100 percent
      somewhat limiting     Aluminum saturation between 2 and 100 percent
      not limiting                Aluminum saturation less than 2 percent
	
	Null aluminum saturation is assigned to the not rated class.

6.  Organic matter  Organic matter in the soil acts as an energy source for many organisms.  

Property used:  WTD_AVG OM 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION
Interpretive thresholds:
      limiting                    Organic matter content less than 0.3 percent
      somewhat limiting   Organic matter content between 0.3 and 3.0
      not limiting              Organic matter content greater than 3.0 percent
	
	Null organic matter is assigned to the not rated class.

7.  Bulk density  The bulk density of a soil provides information about the macropore space and the strength of the soil.  Since organisms live and gases and water flow through the macropores, they are a significant attribute of soil.  However, just the number for bulk density is not very informative, since the soil texture and the density of the soil particles are also factors in identifying an optimal soil density for biologic components.  A sandy soil having a bulk density of 1.4 g/cm3 might not be limited but a clayey soil of the same density will be.  In order to obtain a meaningful metric, an ideal bulk density is calculated for the soil sand, silt, clay, and organic matter content, then this is compared to the observed bulk density.  Just the difference is not entirely informative, because the change in density between ideal and limiting changes for each texture.  In other words, a 0.15 g/cm3 increase in the density of a clayey soil may be more problematic that a similar increase in a sandy soil.

Property used:  BULK DENSITY RATIO MAXIMUM 0 TO 30CM
Interpretive thresholds:
      limiting                    Density ratio greater than 1.0
      somewhat limiting   Density ratio greater between  0 and 1.0
      not limiting              Density ratio less than 0
	
	Null density ration is assigned to the not rated class.

8.  Clay content  Clay sized particles in soil provide surface area for organisms to live on.  

Property used:  WTD_AVG CLAY CONTENT 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION
Interpretive thresholds:
     limiting                       Clay content less than 30 percent
     somewhat limiting      Clay content between 30 and 40 percent
     not limiting                 Clay content greater than 40 percent
	
	Null density ration is assigned to the not rated class."|05/24/2021 20:07:32|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666530"
"TX201"|"AGR - Wind Erosion Potential (TX)"|"limitation"|"Description: AGR - Soil Wind Erosion Potential (TX)
 
Summary:  Soil Wind Erosion Potential (TX) evaluates a soil's potential to erode through the action of wind.  The potential assumes that the area being affected is dry, bare, smooth, and has a long distance that is exposed to the wind.
Scope: The wind erosion potential of the soil is attributed to those soil surface properties that by themselves or in combination with others contribute to the soils wind erosivity potential.  Those soil surface attributes that contribute to erosivity are particle size and carbonate content.  Conversely, soil surface attributes that resist the erosive affect of wind are organic matter content and coarse fragments.  The soil wind erosion potential is the interaction of those soil surface features that make the soil susceptible to wind erosion and those that resist the wind erosion process.

The potential degree of wind erodibility is expressed as a numeric index between 1.0 (Highest potential for erosion) and 0.0 (lowest potential erosion).  The potential degree to which a soil is susceptible to wind erosion will range from ""High"" to ""Low"" (numerically 1.0 to 0.0).  Soils that have favorable surface particle size, high organic matter content, or armoring coarse fragments will have Low wind erosion potential.  Soils that have High wind erosion potential are those with a surface layer that has a sandy particle size, low organic matter content, or no coarse fragment protection.

CRITERIA: Criteria are adapted from Section 618.72:  U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 2005. National Soil Survey Handbook.

The soil's wind erosion potential is an interaction between the surface soil's particle size, carbonate content, organic matter, and the coarse fragment content.  The soil's potential wind erosion is a function of the maximum contribution of surface-layer particle size and/or surface carbonate content, less the opposing effects of surface coarse fragments and/or organic matter content.

Logic:  The model first determines the soils intrinsic wind erosion potential and then adjusts the potential for the armoring effect of coarse fragment and/or aggregate stability contributed to organic matter content.  An example would be soils with high sand or silt content would have ""High"" intrinsic wind erosion potential unless they also have a high content of coarse fragment or organic matter.  In this case, the wind erosion potential would not be as great and would be reduced.

Where:
	Intrinsic Wind Erosivity Factors:
	
	Either the surface layer sand or silt content of the surface layer is => 80% then the soil has high wind erosion potential;
		OR
	The clay content of the surface layer => 40% then the soil has moderately high wind erosion potential;
		OR
	The carbonate content of the surface layer is => 15% then the soil has moderately high wind erosion potential;
		ELSE
	The particle size class of the surface layer is loamy and the wind erosion potential is moderate or lower.

	LESS
	
	Wind Erosivity Opposing Factors:
	
	The organic matter content of the surface soil is => 25;
		PLUS
	The coarse fragment content of the surface layer is => 15%."|08/21/2019 15:55:30|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666386"
"TX201"|"DHS - Emergency Land Disposal of Milk"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Disruptions in the supply chain and other problems can necessitate the emergency disposal of milk.  Land application is a viable method of disposal as the constituents of milk can be beneficial as soil amendments. The characteristics of the soil are important in the application since favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Emergency Land Application of Milk"".  If a soil property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Emergency Land Application of Milk"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Scope: National



Soil properties and qualities considered are those that affect liquid movement into and through the soil, the ability of the soil to attenuate material, the slope of the land surface, the presence of rock fragments, and the volume of soil available for absorbing the milk solids. Soil properties that affect absorption are permeability, the depth to a seasonal high water table, and the depth to bedrock or a cemented pan.   Stones and the depth to a seasonal high water table can interfere with the application of milk.  

Criteria:

	7.  Restricted permeability: The soil horizon with the minimum Ksat governs the rate of water movement through the whole soil.

"TX201"|"DHS - Emergency Animal Mortality Disposal by Shallow Burial"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Emergency Animal Mortality Disposal by Shallow Burial"".  This interpretation is meant to provide another option for carcass disposal following a catastrophic event.  Conceptually, it is very similar to ""above ground burial"", in that a trench from 18 to 24 inches deep is used.   If a soil's property within 91 cm (36 inches) of the soil surface has a membership index greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership index for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Emergency Animal Mortality Disposal by Shallow Burial"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are Not limited (rating index = 0), Slightly limited (rating index >0 and <.30), Somewhat limited (>.30 and <.80), Severely limited (>.80 and <0.99), Very severely limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

""Emergency Animal Mortality Disposal by Shallow Burial"" is a method of disposing dead animals by placing the carcasses in an shallow excavated trench 60 cm (~24 inches) deep or less. The trrench is lined with woodchips, corn stalks, or other organic material, then carcasses are placed. Then, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the burial pit.  It is very similar to the method APHIS calls ""Above Ground Burial"" but the criteria are better-defined.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

The estimated land area needed to dispose of mature cattle ranges from 1.2 (McDaniel, 1991) to 3.5 (Ollis, 2002) cubic yards.  A single adult bovine is considered equivalent to 5 sheep or 5 hogs (McDaniel, 1991; USDA, 1980).  Lund et al estimate that about 92,000 cubic yards of volume would be needed to dispose of 30,000 head of cattle, assuming a trench depth of 8.5 feet (which is somewhat below the depth of observation for typical soil survey).  This is about seven acres.  Leachate collection should be considered because the putrefaction of one adult bovine is estimated to release 21 gallons of fluid in the first week and a total of about 42 gallons in the first month (Munroe, 2001).  Collection of gases released during the decomposition process should also be considered. 

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  However, because pits may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the pit developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential contamination of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of contamination, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the pit.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing pits for which the pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a Emergency Animal Mortality Disposal  Shallow Burial operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled pit area.

Criteria used:

1.  Adsorption:  Soils having a low cec or ecec may not attenuate biohazardous material from the decay process.  It is assumed that the upper 25 cm of the site will be stockpiled for use in revegetating the site.  It is also assumed that alternating layers of soil and biological materials will be placed in the excavation.

Soils having low CEC or ECEC are not able to retain some leachates.  A soil is a full member of the set of soils having low adsorption if the CEC or ECEC to clay ratio is below 0.05, a partial member between 0.05 and 0.15, and a nonmember if the cec or ecec to clay ratio is over 0.150.

			(Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Not Limiting	    = ""none""
		Limiting	not = ""none""
		
	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
10.  Rock Outcrop:  Areas that have rock outcrop in the vicinity are not likely to have a sufficiently large area of soil for the facility.  Rock outcrops can interfere with renovation of the leachate from the facility.
        
        Property used: PA ROCK OUTCROP 2(Modality - representative value)
        
        Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		The phase ""rock outcrop"" occurs in the map unit name.
		Not limiting		The phase ""rock outcrop"" does not occur in the map unit name.
				
Any soil with a portion or full map unit name of Rock Outcrop is returned as a value of 1 and is given the rating of Rock Outcrop and is considered a limitation.

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""rocky"" is returned as a value of .3 and is given the rating of ""Slight Rock Outcrop"".

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""very rocky"" is returned as a value of .7 and is given the rating of ""Severe Rock Outcrop"".

All map units have a name, no null data should be encountered.

11.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's adsorptive capacity and the thickness of the biologically active zone through with waste materials can percolate.  Shallow soils may pose environmental and health risks when agricultural and municipal waste materials are applied. These soils may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when trench landfills are installed. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"" or ""bedrock (paralithic) AND restriction hardness IS NOT extremely weakly, very weakly, or weakly cemented. Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

	Property used: depth to bedrock lithic/paralithic-hardness
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Severely Limiting		 < 91 cm
                                Somewhat Limiting                   91 - 120 cm
		Not limiting		=> 120cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
12.  Slope: Steep slopes impede trafficability of heavy machinery and reclamation of borrow sites.  Soil feature considered is the component slope.
		
	Property used: Slope 5 to 12%
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		> 12%
		Somewhat limiting	>= 5 and <= 12%
		Not limiting		< 5%			
		
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.
	
13.  Water Gathering Surface: Some surfaces are shaped so as to gather water.  This additional water may cause problems for land use.  Soils that are concave up and down their slope and concave across their slope are most strongly water gathering.  Soils that are concave across their slope and linear or convex up and down their slopes are less water collecting.  Soils that are linear across their slopes and concave up and down their slopes are somewhat water collecting.  Soils that are convex up and down their slopes and convex across their slopes are the least water gathering.

Water gathering (concave) surfaces can concentrate water flow and cause accelerated erosion.  Increased costs because of materials and land shaping may be needed to prevent erosion. Wet moisture classes that have water gathering surfaces are more restrictive than drier moisture classes that have water gathering surfaces. 
		  
		  Property Used: WATER GATHERING SURFACE
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		    Somewhat Limiting		Concave up-down, concave across surfaces
		    Slightly limiting		Concave across, linear or convex up-down
		    Not limiting		All other surface shapes
		    
		  NOTE!!!  The fuzzy number returned by this rule can not exceed 0.5.
		  
Null slope shape is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

14. Subaerial Component: Soil components can be on land and also submerged in water less than 2 meters deep. These submerged soil components are referred to as subaqueous. Animal Burial should be conducted on land and not in subaqueous soils. Therefore, any soil components occurring in a subaqeous state should be excluded from consideration for large animal disposal by burial. 
		Property Used:  DRAINAGE CLASS IS NOT SUBAQUEOUS

	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting 		if the component has a subaqeous drainage class populated
Not limiting	if the component has a drainage class that is null or is populated with any drainage class other than subaqeous

"TX201"|"ENG - Source of Caliche (TX)"|"limitation"|"Summary:  Soil survey interpretation for ""ENG - Source of Caliche (TX)"" is made to provide guidance to users in selecting locations where caliche maybe present and identifies caliche limitations.  Soils with low or no limitations may be selected as potential sources of caliche.  Soils with greater caliche limitations maybe source of poorer grades and lesser quantities of caliche because they are nearby, are the only source available, or some physical or chemical properties that limit caliche development.  The use interpretation can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.

Limitation ratings and associated restrictive features are for determining the presence or potential for caliche.  The ratings do not consider the quality of the source material because quality depends on how the source material is to be used.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine potential of the site as a caliche source.  This interpretation helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by identifying soil mapping unit components that are less limiting then others.

The degree of limitation is expressed as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property has a degree of limitation greater than zero, that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less than the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes according to their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

Scope:  State of Texas.

Description:  Caliche is a hardened deposit of calcium carbonate. This calcium carbonate cements together other materials, including gravel, sand, clay, and silt. It is found in aridisol soil orders. The intent of this rating is to show only the probability of finding material in suitable quantity.  The suitability of the gravel for specific purposes is not evaluated.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of caliche.  The properties used to evaluate the soil's limitation as a probable source of gravel are type of cemented pan, CaCO3 concentration, depth, thickness and soil temperature regime.

"TX201"|"SOH - Soil Susceptibility to Compaction"|"limitation"|"Soil Susceptibility to Compaction

Soils can be a full member, partial member, or non-member of the set of soils that are susceptible to compaction.  Soils are rated based on their susceptibility to compaction from the operation of ground-based equipment for planting, harvesting, and site preparation activities when soils are moist.  Soil compaction is the process in which soil particles are pressed together more closely that in the original state.  Typically, the soil must be moist to be compacted because the mineral grains must slide together.  Compaction reduces the abundance mostly of large pores in the soil by damaging the structure of the soil.  This produces several effects that are unwanted in agricultural soils since large pores are most effective at transmitting water and air through the soil.  Compaction also increases the soil strength which can limit root penetration and growth.  The ability of soil to hold water is adversely affected by compaction since the large pores hold water.  The degree of compaction of a soil is measured by its bulk density, which is the mass per volume, generally expressed in grams per cubic centimeter.

Compacted soils are less favorable for good plant growth because of high soil bulk density and hardness, reduced pore space, and poor aeration and drainage. Root penetration and growth is decreased in compacted soils because the hardness or strength of these soils prevents the expansion of roots. Supplies of air, water, and nutrients that roots need are also less favorable when compaction decreases soil porosity and drainage.

Interpretation ratings are based on soil properties in the upper 12 inches of the profile.  Factors considered are soil texture, soil organic matter content, soil structure, rock fragment content, and the existing bulk density.  Each of these is thought to contribute to resisting the susceptibility of a soil to compaction when present.  Organic matter in the soil provides resistance to compaction and the resilience to ameliorate the effects with time.  Soil structure adds strength as discrete aggregates and it is the aggregates that are deformed or destroyed by compactive forces, thus strong soil structure lowers the susceptibility to compaction.  Similarly, rock fragments in the soil can bridge and provide a framework to resist compaction.  Finally, if a soil is already fairly dense causing further compaction is more difficult. 

Definitions of the ratings:

Low - The potential for compaction is insignificant.  This soil is able to support standard equipment with minimal compaction. The soil is moisture insensitive, exhibiting only small changes in density with changing moisture content.

Medium - The potential for compaction is significant.  The growth rate of seedlings may be reduced following compaction.  After the initial compaction (i.e., the first equipment pass), this soil is able to support standard equipment with only minimal increases in soil density.  The soil is intermediate between moisture insensitive and moisture sensitive.

High - The potential for compaction is significant.  The growth rate of seedlings will be reduced following compaction.  After initial compaction, this soil is still able to support standard equipment, but will continue to compact with each subsequent pass.  The soil is moisture sensitive, exhibiting large changes in density with changing moisture content.

Background

Produce farms, urban areas, and suburban neighborhoods can produce large amounts of organic material that may be viewed as waste but is actually a valuable resource.  This material may 
consist of leaves, grass clippings, small tree limbs, and other herbaceous materials.  Composting these materials provides a good source of organic matter to be used as a soil amendment. 

Biological degradation of organic materials forms the basis for composting.  This biological process depends on the active metabolism of microorganisms in a suitable micro-environment. 
The six critical factors for the transformation of organic materials into compost are microorganisms, heat, air, water, carbon, and nitrogen.

The microorganisms that carry out biological degradation for composting often are found in the soil or on the surface of leaves.  These microorganisms thrive in a surface or subsurface 
microclimate with free circulation of air, free flow of water, and a temperature well above freezing. The microorganisms also require carbon as food for energy and growth, as well as 
nitrogen for protein and rebuilding cells.

Composting facilities are designed to provide these six critical factors in relative proportions so that the process of biological degradation is sustained.  Deficits in any of the 
critical factors, or imbalances among them, may result in extremely slow composting or a dormant composting system. Mixing of materials also redistributes heat, air, and water and will 
speed the process of biological degradation. Large facilities may provide mechanical mixing of the compost materials. Smaller facilities may rely on manual turning of the materials or may 
add some materials that are too large to compost in order to create channels for air flow through the pile. 

Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Mean Annual Air Temperature (MAAT) are measures of the soil micro-climate that affects the rate of composting.  Both MAP and MAAT are available from 
the soil survey database.  Composting is most rapid in warm, moist areas that generally have MAP between 450 and 1250 mm together with MAAT between 10 and 22 degrees Celsius.  The optimal 
temperature inside the compost pile is 10 to 15.5 degrees Celsius. In colder areas the rate of composting may be increased by insulating the compost pile on all sides with an extra layer 
of high carbon materials such as hay or newspaper. To avoid extreme cold or rainforest conditions, the composting may be done inside a protected area or a building.  The optimal moisture 
for composting is field capacity, or freely drained but moist. Moisture may need to be added to the compost pile especially if the organic materials are dry such as chipped lumber. 

The ratio of carbon to nitrogen in the organic materials is perhaps the hardest part of the process to regulate.  Active compost piles need a carbon to nitrogen ratio of about 30:1 (30 
units of carbon to 1 unit of nitrogen). Many common materials such as leaves and lumber are high in carbon and require balanced inputs of materials that are high in nitrogen such as 
coffee grounds or manures and urines.  Often the materials high in nitrogen are less available or more difficult to transport to the composting site. Materials intended for composting may 
vary in their carbon to nitrogen ratio due to many factors and testing of materials is recommended before large scale operations begin. A few C:N examples are given in table 1.

Publications (with estimated ratios of carbon to nitrogen)

Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as a ""Farm and Garden Composting Facility - Surface"".  If a soil's property 
within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership 
indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Site for Composting Facility"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not 
considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited 
(rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Site for Farm and Garden Composting Facility - Surface is the site location for placement of a composting facility without the use of a liner or placement on concrete pad. The composting 
facility is to process raw organic by-products into biologically stable organic material as outlined in the NRCS conservation practice standard ""Composting Facility"" (code 317). 

Scope: National

The bottom elevation of the composting facility shall be above the seasonal high water table and on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the 
ground water. Compost facilities should be located outside of floodplains.  However, if site restrictions require location within a floodplain, they shall be protected from inundation or 
damage from a 25-year flood event, or larger. Locate compost facilities so prevailing winds and landscape elements such as building arrangement, landforms and vegetation minimize odors 
and protect the visual resource. Direct any contaminated runoff from compost facilities to an appropriate storage or treatment facility for further management.

Suitability of a soil for use as a site for composting should be on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the ground water. Slope affects the 
ease of accessing and manipulating the compost material.  It also will affect runoff from the site. If slope is limiting, then consult the ""Site for Composting Facility  Subsurface"" 
interpretation.


Soil interpretations for locating a site for composting are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in 
their present condition and does not consider present land use.


Criteria used:


1.  Depth to saturated zone: Shallow depth to water table limits the site for use as a composting facility.  Soils that are shallow to water are also difficult to reclaim and revegetate, 
and contamination from leaching may create health and environmental hazards.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or 
saturated during any month.

	Property used: HIGH WATER TABLE DEPTH MINIMUM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 50 cm
		Somewhat limiting	=> 50 to =< 100 cm
		Not limiting		 > 100 cm
		
	Null depth to saturation is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
2.  Flooding:  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional flooding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value greater than 0 and flooding 
is a limiting feature:

Flooding Frequency	Months
------------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2


3.  Fragments in soil:  Large stone impede the workability of the soil and restrict trafficability of heavy machinery and site reclamation.  Soil feature considered is percent by weight 
rock fragments > 10 inches in size in the surface soil layer.



	Property evaluated: WTD_AVG FRAGS > 250mm 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 > 15 percent
		Somewhat Limiting 	=> 5 to 15 percent
		Not limiting		 < 5 percent
		
	Null surface fragment coverage is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.	



4.  Surface fragments:  Soils that have large fragments on the surface have reduced trafficability.  The large rock fragments on the surface must be removed.  Rock fragment coverage 
criteria are as follows.


	Property evaluated: FRAGMENTS >=250MM ON THE SURFACE  (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 > 15 percent
		Somewhat limiting 	=> 3 to 15 percent
		Not limiting		 < 3 percent
		
	Null surface fragment coverage is assigned to the Well suited class.



5.  Seepage:  The soil horizon with the maximum Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids into and through the soil is 
unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become an environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the layer with the maximum Ksat within a depth of 200cm.

            Property used: KSAT HIGHEST MINIMUM, 0-200CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (Modality - high, low, representative value)

            Restriction limits:
                    Limiting                 	> 42.0 micrometers/sec
                    Somewhat Limiting       	 > 14.1 and <= 42.0 micrometers/sec
                    Not limiting           	 =< 14.1 micrometers/sec

            Null Ksat values are assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.


6.  Depth to permafrost: Permafrost (permanently frozen soil layer) restricts or effects excavation, manipulation, transport, stability, and workability of the soil material.  Soil 
features considered are restrictive feature depth and where kind is permafrost or USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) is ""cpf"" or USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER is ""pf"".
	
	Property used: DEPTH TO PERMAFROST (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 50cm
		Somewhat limiting 	=> 50 to =< 100cm
		Not limiting		 > 100cm
		
	Null depths are assigned  to the Not limiting class.
OR
		
	Property used: USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	= ""cpf""
		Not limiting	not = ""cpf""
		
	Null USDA Texture (In-Lieu-Of) are assigned to the Not limiting class.
OR
		
	Property used: USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	= ""pf""
		Not limiting	not = ""pf""
		
	Null USDA Texture Modifier are assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
7.  Ponding:  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional ponding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value greater than 0 and ponding is 
a limiting feature:

Ponding Frequency	Months
-----------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2



8.  Mean annual precipitation: Localities that have low rainfall are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low rainfall, moisture will need to be added to 
maintain biological activity in the composting mass.  The site feature considered is mean annual precipitation.

	Property used: PRECIPITATION (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 400 mm
		Somewhat limiting	=> 400-1200 mm
		Not limiting		 > 1200 mm
		
	Null precipitation is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.
	
	
	
9.  Slope:  The slope of the soil surface influences its trafficability for equipment and also can cause erosion hazard if steep.

	Property evaluated: SLOPE (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		> 8 percent  
		Somewhat limiting 	<= 8 to 3 percent
		Not limiting		< 3 percent
		
	Null slopes are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	
	
10.  Low strength: Soils with high AASHTO Group Index have low strength which affects the soil's traffic-supporting capacity.  This condition is only partially restrictive when clay 
mineralogy is kaolinitic.  Soil feature considered is the AASHTO Group Index of the
thickest soil layer between 25 and 100cm or above a cemented restrictive layer and taxonomic family mineralogy.

        Property used:AASHTO GROUP INDEX, WEIGHTED AVERAGE IN DEPTH 0-50cm (Modality - high, low, representative value)

        Restriction limits:
                Limiting                	                 => 8
                Somewhat limiting        	> 5 to < 20
                Not limiting           	 	=< 20

        Null AASHTO Group Index values are assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.
        
        
        
11.  Mean annual air temperature: Localities that have very low or very high mean annual air temperature are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low mean annual 
air temperature, the onset of decomposition may be delayed by low biological activity in the composting mass.  The additional expense of covering or insulating the composting mass may be 
incurred.  In very warm areas, adding extra water and more frequent turning of the mass adds to the cost of composting.  The site feature considered is mean annual air temperature.

	Property used: MEAN ANNUAL AIR TEMPERATURE (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 <= 8 and >30 degrees C 
		Somewhat limiting	 8 to <=10 and 22 to <=30 degrees C
		Not limiting		 >10 to <=22 degrees C
		
	Null mean annual air temperature is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class."|07/19/2018 19:46:25|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666479"

Application and Limitations

This interpretation is designed to assess the suitability of soils for Forest Service single lane system roads built to specification with a natural surface. Standard specifications include a grade between 2 and 8 percent, with segments up to 12 percent; a width of about 10 to 14 feet (FSH 7709.56); and drainage structures (Copstead, Johansen, and Moll; 1998).  Roads would be designed to cross the slope, and would be constructed with a cut and fill design in order to maintain grade.  A full bench design would be used on slopes greater than 55 percent (FSH 7709.56).  

This interpretation does not consider geomorphology or geologic information relating to mass stability or landslide risk.  Identifying risk factors for mass instability would be a separate process at a local or regional scale.

Soil properties used in the interpretation criteria include slope gradient, rock fragment content, flooding and ponding frequency, depth to water table, depth to lithic bedrock, AASHTO Group Index as an indicator of soil strength, linear extensibility percent as an indicator of shrink-swell potential, and depth to permafrost.

Soils are placed into suitability classes based on the following numerical ratings:

0.91 - 1.00:   Very well suited
0.51 - 0.90:   Well suited
0.01 - 0.50:   Moderately suited
0.00:              Poorly suited  

Typical uses:

This interpretation can be used for:
 - assessing suitability for new single lane road construction in mountainous or flat terrain, 

- assessing suitability for new Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) trails (50 inches or wider) in mountainous or flat terrain,

- describing soil suitability-related maintenance issues on existing road or OHV trail (50 inches or wider) networks.

Biochar is the solid byproduct of the decomposition of organic materials in oxygen-limited environments at high temperatures, known as pyrolysis. The extremely carbon-rich material has an average half-life of 1,400 years, due to its recalcitrant condensed aromatic ring structure, allowing it to sequester carbon in soils over long periods of time, with the potential to provide substantial increases to soil organic matter. Although it has only recently begun to receive attention as a soil health amendment, biochar has been used to increase the fertility, productivity, and health of soils around the world by indigenous communities for thousands of years, most notably in the Amazon rainforest.

The feedstock used to produce biochar has a significant impact on its properties. Many waste products can be pyrolized to produce biochar.  These include forestry wastes, grass clippings, manure, food wastes, and many other waste products.  This interpretation assumes a corn stover and manure waste feedstock, producing a mid-range particle size, ideally sourced locally. Relatively few large-scale biochar producers exist in the United States presently, resulting in a high cost ranging from $1200-$1500/ton. This interpretation assumes a minimal incorporation with tillage, rather spreading the biochar with a manure surface spreader.   Application methods vary.  The biochar can be mixed with manure and spread as a part of a slurry.

Soil and site properties can be dynamic (changeable on a human timescale) or more or less invariant.  Soil properties associated with soil health include pH, cation exchange capacity, water holding capacity, bulk density, hydraulic conductivity, and organic matter content.  These properties affect aggregate stability, fungal growth, and microbial activity, which in turn affect plant growth.  Conceptually, these properties may be improved by the application of biochar. Soils that are in the least favorable condition initially may show the most improvement in their health following biochar application. Some conditions of the site, such as slope, ponding, flooding, karst, and rock fragment content, while affecting the application and use of biochar, cannot be changed by biochar application.

Criteria used:
 
 
1. Water Table Rule (Biochar Response):  Water table depth -The presence of a shallow water table during the growing season will affect spreading of the biochar due to the possibility of rutting and soil compaction.  Whether or not the shallow water table will affect the function of the biochar is unknown. 
 
Property evaluated: WATER TABLE DEPTH, GROWING SEASON
 
Suitability limits:       Well suited        >75cm
                                 Somewhat suited    15 to 75cm
                                 Poorly suited      <15cm
 
Null water table data is assigned to the ""Well suited"" class.
 
2. CPS808 - Karst landform: The presence of karst topography implies rapid transport of water to an aquifer with little or no filtering. 
 
Property evaluated: GEOMORPHIC FEATURE NAMES (SINKHOLE)
 
Suitability limits:    Well suited      No sinkholes present
                              Poorly suited    Sinkholes present
 
Null geomorphic feature data is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.

Property evaluated: KARST MAPUNIT NAME

                              Poorly suited    Map unit name contains ""karst""
 
Null map unit name data is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.

 
3. CPS808 - Slope 6  to > 15%: Slope -  For ease of tillage and cultivation slopes less than 6 percent are best for application of biochar. If site has slopes greater than 15 percent tillage and cultivation will be limited, and risk of erosion will increase and the safe operation of machinery becomes a consideration. 

Property evaluated: SLOPE
 
Suitability limits:       Well suited        <6 percent
                                 Somewhat suited    6 to 15 percent
                                 Poorly suited      >15 percent
 
Null slope data is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.
 

 
4. CPS808 - Cobble and Stone Content 0-30cm: Rock fragment content - excessive rock fragment in the rooting zone dilutes the soil, affecting the volume of soil remaining to contribute nutrients and water.  Rock fragment volume also affects heat and water movement in soil.  Volumetric rock fragment content is examined from 0 to 30 cm and the surface stone coverage is considered.
 
      a. Property evaluated: FRAGMENTS >=75MM MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-30CM
 
                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        <2 percent
                                                          Somewhat suited     2 to 15 percent
                                                          Poorly suited      >15 percent
 
                          Null volumetric rock fragment data is assigned to the ""Well suited"" class.
 
      b. Property evaluated: FRAGMENTS >=250MM ON SURFACE
 
                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        <0.1 percent
                                                          Somewhat suited     0.1 to 3 percent
                                                          Poorly suited      >3 percent
 
                          Null surface fragment coverage data is assigned to the ""Well suited"" class.
 
5. CPS808 - Ponding Rating (Suitability): Ponding - water ponded on the surface can cause the biochar to float and concentrate on the downwind side of the ponded area. 

Property evaluated: PONDING FREQUENCY RATER
 
                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        None and null
                                                          Somewhat suited    Rare and occasional
                                                          Poorly suited      Common and frequent
 
                          Null ponding data is assigned to the ""Well suited"" class.
 
6. CPS808 - Flooding Frequency Rating (Suitability): Flooding - Flooding criteria are similar to those of the ponding criteria except they involve flowing water. Flood waters can move biochar away from the intended site. 

Property evaluated: FLOODING FREQUENCY RATER
 
                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        None, null, and very rare
                                                          Somewhat suited    Rare and occasional
                                                          Poorly suited      Frequent and very frequent
 
                          Null flooding data is assigned to the ""Well suited"" class.
 
 
7. CPS808 - AWC Average 0-30cm: Available water holding capacity is a soil attribute that is claimed to be enhanced by biochar application.  Soils with low water holding capacity will be benefitted the most from the biochar.

Property evaluated: AWC AVG 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION, BELOW O HORIZON
 
                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        <0.02 cm/cm
                                                          Somewhat suited    0.02 to 0.2 cm/cm
                                                          Poorly suited      >0.2 cm/cm
 
                          Null AWS data is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.
 
8. CPS808 - Organic Carbon, kg/m2 to 30cm: Organic carbon content - The organic carbon content of a soil is beneficial in many ways. Organic matter can provide nutrients to plants, increase water holding capacity and improve soil aggregation. Soil has been shown to be a good sink for carbon to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. The best response will be seen in soils having low initial carbon content.

Property evaluated: ORGANIC CARBON IN KG/M2 TO 30CM
 
                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        <2 kilograms
                                                          Somewhat suited    2 to 10 kilograms
                                                          Poorly suited      >10 kilograms
 
                          Null organic carbon data is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.
 
9. CPS808 - pH WTD_AVG 0-30 Suitability: Soil pH - Neutral soils are ideal as nutrients are most chemically available within that range. Biochar normally is alkaline, so it is expected that application of biochar will increase the pH of soils that are acidic. Excessively high soil pH can cause micronutrients to be bound up and render them plant unavailable.  

Property evaluated: WTD_AVG PH 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION
 
                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        <5.5 
                                                          Somewhat suited    5.5 to 7.5
                                                          Poorly suited      >7.5
 
                          Null pH data is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.
 
 
10.  CPS808 - Bulk Density Ratio Max 0-30cm: Bulk density - bulk density affects air and water flow through a soil.  Also, when soils are compacted, root penetration is impeded.  Biochar is alleged to decrease soil bulk density, since it has an inherently low bulk density.  A ratio of the reported bulk density as compared to a calculated ideal bulk density is used a metric of compaction.  Soils that are already somewhat compacted are thought to obtain the most benefit from biochar. 

Property evaluated: BULK DENSITY RATIO MAXIMUM 0-30 CM
 
                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        >0.4 
                                                          Somewhat suited    0 to 0.4 
                                                          Poorly suited      <0 
 
                          Null bulk density data is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.
 
 
13. CPS808 - MEQ 0-30cm: Milliequivalents of exchange is calculated on a volumetric basis from the populated cation exchange capacity data.  This proves to be more useful in comparing soils of differing rock fragment content and bulk density. It is analogous to AWS, in that the amount of exchange in a 1 cm square to the stated depth is estimated.  CEC is largely driven by organic matter content and clay which provide abundant exchange sites.  Biochar is alleged to provide abundant exchange sites to enhance the nutrient-holding capability of soils.  Soil having the least initial CEC will be benefittwed the most.

Property evaluated: MEQ 0-30cm OR RESTRICTION
 
                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        <4 meq from 0-30cm 
                                                          Somewhat suited    4 to 12 meq from 0-30cm 
                                                          Poorly suited      >12 meq from 0-30cm 
 
                          Null cation exchange capacity data is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.
 
 
14. CPS808 - Ksat Max 0-30cm: Ksat- measures the transmisivity of water in the soil profile. Ksat is related to clay content of the soil.  If a soil is too transmissive, the water will leave the profile and will remove nutrients with it.  Biochar is thought to reduce the hydraulic conductivity of some soils. 
 
Property evaluated: KSAT MAX 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION, BELOW O HORIZON
 
                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        >40 um/sec 
                                                          Somewhat suited    14 to 40 um/sec 
                                                          Poorly suited      <14 um/sec 
 
                          Null hydraulic conductivity is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.
 
 15. CPS808 - LEP Max 0-30cm: Linear extensibility percent is a measure of how much a soil shriks and swell upon drying and wetting.  LEP is related to clay content and type of clay in the soil.  If LEP is excessive, the biochar may move downward through the cracks and out of the root zone. 

Property evaluated: LEP MAX 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION, BELOW O HORIZON
 
                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        <4 percent 
                                                          Somewhat suited    4 to 12 percent  
                                                          Poorly suited      >12 percent 
 
                          Null LEP is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.

"TX201"|"AGR - Industrial Hemp for Fiber and Seed Production"|"suitability"|"Summmary:

Industrial hemp produced for fiber and seed is seeing a resurgence in interest from farmers in many states.  Although commonly cultivated in the United States prior to the 1940s, it fell out of vogue with the advent of other materials for producing rope and textiles.  Industrial hemp is a non-drug variety of Cannabis sativa which has very low levels (<0.3%) of the psychoactive compound, tetrahydracannabinal (THC).  It is a highly productive plant which can grow in a variety of climate and soil conditions.  Any machinery that is easily adjustable, such as row widths, and performs well is suitable for sowing industrial hemp. Standard grain drills and modified alfalfa seeders are examples of suitable machinery. Ease of converting farm equipment to sow seeds makes this an appealing alternative. Ideally, industrial hemp should be incorporated into a four-year crop rotation. Industrial hemp does require an adequate amount of nutrients. Major nutrients include but, not limited to: (1) nitrogen, (2) potassium, and (3) phosphorus. Industrial hemp's dense canopy  makes for effective weed suppression. 

Industrial Hemp was originally produced for the fibers that assisted in the creation of textile materials. However, throughout the years there has been development in the production of several products that are the outcome of further processing and refinement of the plant. These products are as follow: agriculture, automotive, construction materials, food/nutrition/beverages, furniture, paper, personal care, recycling, and textiles. These products are all outcomes of time and innovation of the fibers and seeds of the plant. 

Industrial hemp requires certain soil and site characteristics for optimum growth.  Slope, soil drainage, depth to restrictive layer, frost-free days, ponding, flooding, rock fragment cover, and rock fragment content are important characteristics that are not easily altered.  If any one of these attributes is unsuited for growing a crop, then the site is not suited.  Other soil characteristics, such as available water storage, organic matter content, pH, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, and hydraulic conductivity, while important, will generally not render a soil unsuited if one or two of these characteristics is sub-optimal.  Also, these characteristics can be made more suitable when the soil is managed for optimal soil health. 

Two things need to be remembered about the ""Industrial Hemp for Fiber and Seed Production"" model.  First, it is important to consider that this interpretation describes the suitability of a soil and site for industrial hemp production and does not necessarily imply a predicted yield, although better suited soils may be more productive.  Second, the model assumes that if the crop needs to be irrigated due to insufficient precipitation, then water at appropriate levels will be applied.  European studies show that industrial hemp requires 500 to 700 mm of moisture for optimum yield.  Thus, annual precipitation will need to be higher than that range, depending on the soil and evapotranspiration.  Research in the Midwest suggests 600 to 800mm of annual precipitation is needed.  Hemp does not tolerate ""wet feet"".

Criteria used:


1. Water Table Rule (Industrial Hemp):  Water table depth -The literature review reiterated the theme that industrial hemp does not grow well in wet soils.  One reference gave the specific measure of less than 50 cm (Nelson, 1999).   The suitability values were taken from our standard water table depth class definitions of shallow, moderately deep, deep, and very deep.

Property evaluated: WATER TABLE DEPTH, GROWING SEASON

Suitability limits:       Well suited        >200cm
                          Somewhat suited    40 to 200cm
                          Poorly suited      <40cm

Null soil moisture data is assigned to the ""Well Suited"" class.

2. Depth to Restriction (Industrial Hemp): Root restricting layer - Adequate rooting depth and volume are important aspects of soil suitability for crop production.

Property evaluated: DEPTH TO FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE

Suitability limits:    Well suited      >150cm
                       Somewhat suited   50 to 150cm
                       Poorly suited    <50cm


Null restriction depth data is assigned to the ""Well Suited"" class.

3. Slope (Industrial Hemp): Slope -  For ease of tillage and cultivation slopes less than 4 percent are best for industrial hemp for fiber cultivation. If site has slopes greater than 8 percent tillage and cultivation will be limited, and risk of erosion will increase and the safe operation of machinery becomes a consideration.  (NSSH)

Property evaluated: SLOPE

Suitability limits:       Well suited        <4 percent
                          Somewhat suited    4 to 25 percent
                          Poorly suited      >25 percent

Null slope data is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

4. Frost Free Days (Industrial Hemp): Frost-free days - Hemp has a wide amplitude for growing season, however, numerous references indicated that 100 to 120 day frost-free season was optimum for production.  Young hemp plants are frost tolerant down to -5 degrees C (Nelson, 1999).  It was indicated that below 40 degrees latitude in areas experiencing 120 or more frost-free days, it was possible to double crop industrial hemp.

Property evaluated: FROST-FREE DAYS

Suitability limits:       Well suited        >100 frost-free days
                          Somewhat suited    80 to 100 frost-free days
                          Poorly suited      <80 frost-free days

Null frost-free days data is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

5. RZ Rock Fragment (Industrial Hemp): Rock fragment content - excessive rock fragment in the rooting zone dilutes the soil, affecting the volume of soil remaining to contribute nutrients and water.  Rock fragment volume also affects heat and water movement in soil.  Volumetric rock fragment content is examined from 0 to 20 cm and 20 to 150cm.

      a. Property evaluated: ROCK FRAGMENT CONTENT 0-20cm OR RESTRICTION

                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        <2 percent
                                                    Somewhat suited     2 to 80 percent
                                                    Poorly suited      >80 percent

                          Null volumetric rock fragment data is assigned to the ""Well suited"" class.

      b. Property evaluated: ROCK FRAGMENT CONTENT 0-150cm OR RESTRICTION

                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        <2 percent
                                                    Somewhat suited     2 to 80 percent
                                                    Poorly suited      >80 percent

                          Null volumetric rock fragment data is assigned to the ""Well suited"" class.

6. Ponding (Industrial Hemp): Ponding - the literature consistently supported the idea that industrial hemp likes well drained soils and would not tolerate much ponding or flooding.  Wet soils would lead to stunted plants and reduced yields at a minimum or at the worst complete crop failure. 

Property evaluated: PONDING FREQUENCY RATER

                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        None and null
                                                    Somewhat suited    Rare and occasional
                                                    Poorly suited      Common and frequent

                          Null ponding data is assigned to the ""Well suited"" class.

7. Flooding (Industrial Hemp): Flooding - Flooding criteria are similar to those of the ponding criteria except they involve flowing water. Hemp responds best to a well drained, loam soil with a pH (acidity) above 6.0.  Young plants are very sensitive to wet soils or flooding during the first 3 weeks or until growth reaches the fourth internode (about 30 cm. tall). Water-damaged plants will remain stunted, resulting in a weedy, uneven and poor crop. 

Property evaluated: FLOODING FREQUENCY RATER

                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        None, null, and very rare
                                                    Somewhat suited    Rare and occasional
                                                    Poorly suited      Frequent and very frequent

                          Null flooding data is assigned to the ""Well suited"" class.

8. Surface Frags Cover 3-15% (Industrial Hemp): Surface Fragments - any soil rated for agricultural production must consider surface rock fragments and their effect on farm equipment.  

Property evaluated: GRL-FRAGMENTS >250 MM ON SURFACE

                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        <3 percent surface coverage
                                                    Somewhat suited    3 to 15 percent surface coverage
                                                    Poorly suited      > 15 percent surface coverage

                          Null surface fragment data is assigned to the ""Well suited"" class.



9. Available Water Storage (Industrial Hemp): Available water storage (AWS) - sandy textured soils should be avoided. Soils with low water holding capacity will be too droughty for industrial hemp. Hemp grows best with readily available water during the first 30 days after planting to help develop root systems (Dewey, 1910).

Property evaluated: AWC 0-150cm OR FIRST ROOT RESTRICTIVE LAYER

                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        >20 cm
                                                    Somewhat suited    10 to 20cm
                                                    Poorly suited      < 10cm

                          Null AWS data is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.

10. Organic Matter (Industrial Hemp): Organic Matter Content - Fiber production is best on soils that are higher in organic matter.  Organic matter can provide nutrients to plants, increase water holding capacity and improve soil aggregation. Too much OM can increase the P concentration in the soils to levels beyond plant needs.  Soils should contain at least 3.5% organic matter for optimum yields (Nelson, 1999). 

Property evaluated: WTD AVG OM 0 TO 50 CM

                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        3.5 to 10 percent
                                                    Somewhat suited    1 to 3.5 and 10 to 20 percent
                                                    Poorly suited      <1 percent and >20percent

                          Null organic matter data is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.

11. pH (Industrial Hemp): Soil pH - Neutral soils are ideal as nutrients are most chemically available within that range.  The literature supported this sentiment stating hemp prefers slightly acid to neutral pH values.  A reference out of Texas stated that neutral to slightly alkaline also had good production rates.  

Property evaluated: pH1to1H2O MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-30CM

                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        6.1 to 7.3 
                                                    Somewhat suited    5 to 6.1 and 7.3 to 8.4
                                                    Poorly suited      <5 percent and >8.4

                          Null pH data is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.


12.  Electrical Conductivity (Industrial Hemp): Electrical conductivity - industrial hemp is a saline sensitive crop. Soils with EC of less than 4 dS/m are well suited, 4 to 8 dS/m are moderately suited and greater than 8dS/m are poorly suited. Excess salts in the soil will increase plant stress and reduces yields. Soils having an excessively low EC are also shown to have less crop growth because basic cations and other nutrients are limiting.

Property evaluated: BULK EC 0-50cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION

                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        1 to 1.5 dS/m 
                                                    Somewhat suited    0.5 to 1 and 1.5 to 8 dS/m 
                                                    Poorly suited      <0.5 percent and >8 dS/m 

                          Null electrical conductivity data is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.


13. Cation Exchange Capacity (Industrial Hemp): Cation exchange capacity - CEC is largely driven by organic matter content and clay which provide abundant exchange sites.  Studies on industrial hemp support a positive correlation of CEC to hemp production, however, there is also the indication that hemp yields are reduced on high clay soils in part due to a high shrink swell capacity.  The breaks chosen for CEC values for poorly suited are very low CEC (sandy soils) or very high CEC (high clay soils) at the tails of the range.  Moderate suited values come more towards the middle of the range and well suited values for CEC occupy the mid-range of these values.

Property evaluated: CEC/ECEC WTAVG 0-50 CM BELOW O

                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        >15 meq/100g 
                                                    Somewhat suited    5 to 15 meq/100g 
                                                    Poorly suited      <5 meq/100g 

                          Null cation exchange capacity data is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.


14. Ksat (Industrial Hemp): Ksat- measures the transmisivity of water in the soil profile. Ksat is related to clay content of the soil.  Hemp has been described as not performing well in clayey soils. Soils with ksat values below 0.1 to will limit root growth and could increase the risk of fungal infection.  Hemp is susceptible to Scleroritinia scelorotiorum (white mold and Botrytis cinerea (grey mold)), moist soils encourage the growth of these molds.  

Property evaluated: KSAT MAX HIGH, 0-150CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION

                          Suitability limits:       Well suited        1 to 100 um/sec 
                                                    Somewhat suited    0.1 to 100 and 100 to 1000 um/sec 
                                                    Poorly suited      <0.1 and >1000 um/sec 

                          Null hydraulic conductivity is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.

"TX201"|"SAS - Eelgrass Restoration Suitability"|"suitability"|"Introduction
Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is a term used to describe rooted, vascular plants that grow completely underwater except for periods of brief exposure at low tides. The term SAV is generally used for marine, estuarine, and riverine angiosperms, and macrophytes. 

Eelgrass, a kind of seagrass, is the only true marine SAV found in Long Island Sound (LIS) and is Rhode Islands primary seagrass. Eelgrass, Zostera marina, is a flowering marine plant that forms extensive meadows or patchy beds interspersed with bare areas, and the location of these beds can shift over time. Eelgrass beds are always completely submerged, and their roots, known as rhizomes, anchor the grass to the soil.

Eelgrass beds rank among the most productive of marine and estuarine plant habitats. Eelgrass habitat supports an abundant diversity of life, stabilizes seafloor sediments and adjacent shorelines, helps maintain water quality, and is a critical component of the marine food web. Eelgrass grows in areas of specific, though diverse, environmental conditions. Substrate requirements range from sand and gravel to mud. 

In LIS, eelgrass is found at depths between 0.5 and 3.6 meters below mean low water (Koch and Beer, 1996). In Rhode Island, eelgrass grows in nearshore waters at depths ranging 1 to 4.5 meters. The upper limit of growth is determined by physical factors such as wave action, ice scour, and desiccation (TSCHR, 2003).

Purpose
Eelgrass habitat is at risk. Over the last century, seagrass coverage worldwide has declined by about 30 percent (WWF, 2015). During the 1930s, much of the eelgrass succumbed to wasting disease, a widespread infection partly attributed to the slime mold Labryinthula zosterae. Within two years, 90 percent of all eelgrass populations in the North Atlantic (from Canada to North Carolina) disappeared (Kerr et al. 2012).

This soil interpretation is intended to help identify appropriate site selection for eelgrass restoration. While conservation and protection of existing eelgrass beds are the best strategies for addressing this problem, restoring areas that supported eelgrass habitat in the past is a valuable management measure. 
Because the habitats are underwater, the cost of collecting, preparing, and planting eelgrass can be significant.  With the availability of more subaqueous soils data, preliminary GIS analysis for successful eelgrass restoration site selections will be significantly improved. 

Evaluation Criteria
The evaluation criteria for this interpretation are based on soil properties or characteristics that are important in determining eelgrass growth, germination, survival, and distribution. These soil properties correspond to criteria identified and deemed significant by the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service and National Cooperative Soil Survey partners. The evaluation criteria are:

Water Depth
Soil Particle Size
Rock Fragments
Soil Organic Matter
Electrical Conductivity

Soil Rating Classes

High Suitability: Soils that have a high potential for successful eelgrass restoration because they have the best soil properties and/or characteristics for a successful establishment. 
Moderate Suitability: Soils that have a moderate potential for successful eelgrass restoration due to one or more somewhat limiting soil properties and/or characteristics such as water depth, percent silt and clay, percent organic matter, presence of reduced monosulfides, oxidized pH, and electrical conductivity.
Low Suitability: Soils that have a low potential for successful eelgrass restoration due to multiple limiting soil properties and/or characteristics.
Not Suitable: Soils that are not suitable for eelgrass restoration because they are freshwater subaqueous soils that lack the appropriate salinity levels necessary for the establishment and growth of eelgrass.
Not Rated: Soils or miscellaneous areas that are not subaqueous soils are not rated.

"TX201"|"Soil Habitat for Saprophyte Stage of Coccidioides"|"suitability"|"Soil as Habitat for Coccidioides

Valley fever or coccidioidomycosis is caused by the soil-borne fungi Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii which are endemic to the Southwest United States and a few other places in Central and South America.  The symptoms of the disease range from none at all to mild cold or flu-like conditions in most people.  However, some people experience the disseminated form of the disease, which can kill.  

According to Kolivras et al (2001), the life cycle of fungus consists of a saprophytic and parasitic phases.  The saprophytic phase lives in soil as entangled mycelia and hyphae.  The hyphae grow and mature to produce generally rectangular arthrospores.  The arthrospores are 1.5 to 4.5 microns in width and 5 to 30 microns in length.  These spores move easily in air currents.  The parasitic phase occurs in nature under dry, dusty conditions when a host mammal inhales airborne arthrospores.  The fungus in this phase grows as spherules that mature and burst, releasing endospores that can grow into new spherules in the host lungs, inducing valley fever (Kolivras et al, 2001).  

The most commonly thought of habitat for Coccidioides spp is the Lower Sonoran Life Zone, according to Maddy (1957).  This corresponds to the climate of south central Arizona, where the mean July temperature is about 32 degrees C, the mean January temperature is about 10 degrees C, and the annual rainfall is about 23 cm (Maddy, 1958).  Egeberg et al (1964) found that high temperature and salinity in the soil surface has the effect of enhancing Coccidioides spp while inhibiting its competitors.  The fungus needs soil that is moist and then dry and hot to grow and reproduce (Kolivras et al, 2001).  Soils containing substantial amounts of organic matter, such as animal burrows or human middens, are also favorable to Coccidioides spp (Egeberg and Ely, 1956).  Fisher et al (2007) report Coccidioides immitis as being found primarily in the central valley of California (hence valley fever) and Coccidioides posadasii occurring in the endemic areas outside of California.  This suggests that the fungus has evolved separate xeric and aridic forms.  This is significant when considering the timing of wetting and drying cycles needed for the fungus to grow.

Many prior maps of endemic areas are made from testing people for reactivity to coccidioidin and not the soil for presence of the fungi (Edwards and Palmer, 1957).  The objective of the current study is to use the soil survey database to identify areas that are potentially habitat for this soil-borne fungus.  This approach will allow habitat mapping at far finer spatial resolutions than has even been done in the past.  This will allow habitat considerations to be targeted in the planning stage of any soil disturbing activity so as to proactively apply dust control methods when needed.  The criteria mapped are as follows.  The mean annual precipitation (about 230mm) and air temperature (about 20 degrees C) found in the Lower Sonoran Life Zone are used as the optima for habitat.  For xeric areas, the rainfall can be somewhat higher and the temperature somewhat lower.   Southerly slope aspect, moderate slope gradient, and low surface albedo are used to better capture extreme soil surface temperature effects.  Electrical conductivity of over 4dS/m, soil reaction of at least 8.0, or the presence of gypsum in the upper 30cm of the soil are used to indicate an environment high in soluble salts.   Some organic matter and water storage must be present in the soil for the saprophytic phase to grow.  Soil components fitting all of those specifications, at least marginally, are considered possible habitat for the fungus.  Variation in rainfall and temperature from year to year can increase or decrease the range of Coccidioides spp (Kolivras et al, 2001).

Criteria:

1.  Organic carbon -- Since Coccidioides is a saprophyte, organic carbon must be available for it to live in the soil.  The spatial distribution of organic carbon is notoriously spotty in nature, so local areas of much higher or lower organic carbon content, while known to exist, are difficult to quantify.


Property used:  ORGANIC CARBON IN KG/M2 TO 30CM (modality - representative value)

Thresholds:
                                    0 to <6kg/m2              somewhat suited
                                    >= 6kg/m2                  well suited

Minimum fuzzy number returned is 0.5.

2.  Slope shape --  Water Gathering Surface: Some surfaces are shaped so as to gather material while others spread it.  Increased water supply may stimulate fugal growth and can concentrate spores on the surface, enhancing some landforms as a source of spores.  The surface which has the least tendency to gather is convex up down and convex across.  The most concentrating surface is concave up-down and concave across.  The actual driver is more likely to be subsurface flow to discharge areas that concentrate the salts and enhance the habitat.

3.  Climate -- Coccidioides needs  a climate that is hot and dry.  However, the climate cannot be so dry or hot  that the fungus cannot live.  Whether the climate is xeric or non-xeric influences the temperature and precipitation optima for the fungi in a climate because of the distribution of rainfall through the year.  Two major endemic areas demonstrate the difference.  Kern County, California, in the San Joaquin Valley, has a xeric climate receiving about 300mm of annual rainfall with dry summers and an annual average air temperature of 16.4 C.  Phoenix, Arizona, also a highly endemic area in a non-xeric climate, receives about 225mm of annual rainfall more or less evenly through the year and an annual average air temperature of 21.6C.  The additional increment of heat serves to dry the soil after summer rains.

While air temperature and soil surface temperature are related, it is the temperature of the soil surface that provides the environment for the fungi.  Soil surface temperature is influenced by the slope, reflectance, and aspect of the surface.  There is a limit to how hot the soil surface can be without destroying the fungal spores.  The variation in slope, aspect, and reflectance across a landscape ensures that some places will climatically support fungal growth in areas that are generally not considered habitat.   Conversely, some places will not be as conducive to coccidioides as others in areas that are generally climatically suitable.

Two basic climate types are addressed: xeric and non-xeric.  The distinction is made because the mean annual air temperature and rainfall optima are different based on the distribution of rainfall during the year.

The fuzzy number from the Slope Heating sub-rule is multiplied by this number.  This product is added to the Xeric Mean Annual Air Temperature fuzzy number.  The sum is then multiplied by the Xeric Mean Annual Precipitation fuzzy number to derive the climatic score for a xeric soil component.

The fuzzy number returned cannot be less than 0.1.

Null aspect is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

The ratio of the populated mean annual air temperature to the optimum of 18.5 C is evaluated.  Ratios over 1 return a 1, thus the value of the temperature limiter can range from 0 to 1.  The fuzzy number from the Slope Heating sub-rule is multiplied by this number.  This product is added to the Non-Xeric Mean Annual Air Temperature fuzzy number.

4.  Water Retention Difference -- Water retention difference (WRD) is the amount of water the soil can hold between 15 and 1/3 bars.  The frame of reference is limited to the upper 30cm of soil.  The fungus needs to have some water available for growth.  

Property used: WRD 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION (Modality - high, low, representative value)
Thresholds:
		Poorly suited		=< 5 percent by volume
		Somewhat suited 	                > 5.0 to 11.0  percent by volume
		Well suited		=>11.0  percent by volume 
		
Null wrd is assigned to the Not rated class.

5. Salinity  - The habitat for Coccidioides sp needs to have the osmotic effects attributed to high soluble salt content in the soil.  The salinity is thought to give the valley fever fungus an advantage by suppressing its competitors when the soil becomes dry.  Typically, salinity is estimated using the electrical conductivity of the soil.  For this model, the gypsum content, soil reaction, and sodium absorption ratio are used as ways to see if a soil component might be associated with indicators of an abundance of cations in solution or salinity, since all these factors are correlated with salinity.

5.1 Salinity: Soils with high salinity have reduced available water capacity.  Soil feature considered is the highest salinity (electrical conductivity) for the surface 30cm.

		Well suited		  > 10 mmhos/cm			
		
	Null EC is assigned to the ""Poorly suited"" class.

5.2 Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio in the thickest layer have the potential to restrict plant and other organism growth.  Soil feature considered is the thickest layer's sodium adsorption ratio within a depth of 100cm or above a cemented restrictive feature.
		
	Property used: WTD_AVG SAR 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:

	Null gypsum values are assigned to the Not limiting class.

5.4 -- High pH in the soil is evidence that a high soluble salt content may also exist in the soil.  Soil feature considered is the minimum pH (either measured as 1 to 1 water or .01m CaCl2) of soil layer from 0-30cm.

The fuzzy numbers resulting from the sub-rules are multiplied together.  The square root of this value is taken.  This number is then divided by 0.95 as a normalizing factor.  The resulting number is the Habitat Suitability Index."|04/28/2020 19:21:28|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666564"

Summary:  Soil interpretations for Mulch Tillage (TX) evaluate a soil's suitability for Mulch Tillage conservation practices.  These practices manage the amount, orientation and distribution of crop and other plant residue on the soil surface year round while limiting the soil-disturbing activities used to grow crops in systems where the entire field surface is tilled prior to planting.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

Mulch Tillage conservation practices are normally established as part of a conservation management system to address the soil, water, air, plant, and animal needs and the owner's objectives.  Mulch Tillage operations reduce sheet and rill erosion, wind erosion, CO2 emissions, improve soil organic matter content, and increase plant available moisture.

The degree of suitability is expressed as a numeric index between 1 (suited condition) and 0 (unsuited condition).  If an individual soil feature within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface is assigned a degree of suitability less then one, then that soil feature is restrictive and the soil feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum degree of suitability of each soil interpretive feature considered in the rating process.  Soil features having a greater degree of suitability then the minimum are identified and provides the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support Mulch Tillage conservation practice.

The degree to which a soil is suited to Mulch Tillage conservation practices will range from ""Suited"" to ""Unsuited"".  Soils that have no or very minor limiting features are classified ""Excellent"" for Mulch Tillage practices.  The degree of suitability for these soils is => 1.0 and < 0.90.  Soils in rating class ""Good"" have some soil feature or features that may limit Mulch Tillage operations but these features do not pose significant constraints to the soils capacity to support Mulch Tillage conservation practices.  The degree of suitability for these soils is => 0.90 and < 0.50.  Soils in rating class ""Fair"" have soil feature or features that limit Mulch Tillage operations but these features do not render the soil unsuited in its capacity to support Mulch Tillage conservation practices.  The degree of suitability for these soils is => 0.50 and < 0.10.  Soils in rating class ""Poor"" have soil feature or features that limit Mulch Tillage operations and these features pose significant constraints to the soils capacity to support Mulch Tillage conservation practices.  The degree of suitability for these soils is => 0.10 and =< 0.0.  

Scope: The soil properties and qualities considered in the ratings are those that affect tillage operation, crop growth, and other necessary mechanical operations.  The soil properties that affect Mulch Tillage practice establishment and continuance are soil drainage, surface gravel, cobbles, and stones, flooding, ponding, depth to water table, slope, depth, and soil stickiness.

Definition

Prime farmland is land that has the best combination of physical and chemical
characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops, and is
suitable for cropland, pastureland, rangeland, or forestland. It is not suited to
urban or water use. It has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply
needed to economically produce sustained high yields of crops when treated and
managed, including water management, according to acceptable farming
methods. Prime farmland is defined in the Federal Register, Vol. 6, Parts 400-
699, January 1, 2001, Section 657.5(a). Slight modification are applied to the
criteria of slope and soil permeability as outlined in Section 657.4(a),(2).

Criteria

The unit used to evaluate a tract of land for prime farmland is the soil map unit.
Information for evaluating the soil map unit is available in this handout, the soil
handbook descriptive legend for specific survey areas, the published soil survey,
and on-site inspection. Prime farmland must meet or exceed the following:
Moisture Supply: Texas is divided into three moisture zones.

than 6 inches in the upper 40 inches of the soil profile

OR

Moisture Zone 2: Soil has a total available water capacity equal to or greater
than 4 inches in the upper 40 inches of the soil profile and
has a developed irrigation water supply that is dependable
and meets minimum quality standards for irrigation water. A
dependable water supply has water available for irrigating
the major commonly grown crops at least 8 out of 10 years.
The quality of the irrigation water can be determined by past
use (i.e., no apparent damage to soil or plants, or by a water
sample test)

Moisture Zone 3: Soil must have a total available water capacity equal to or
greater than 4 inches in the upper 40 inches of the soil
profile and must have a developed irrigation water supply
that is dependable and meets minimum quality standards for
irrigation water. A dependable water supply has water
available for irrigating the major commonly grown crops at
least 8 out of 10 years. The quality of the irrigation water can
be determined by past use (i.e., no apparent damage to soil
or plants, or by a water sample test)

2.  Temperature: The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is more than 32
degrees F. For the purpose of classification of prime farmland, all soils in Texas
are considered as having a mean annual soil temperature of 59 degrees F or
higher.

3.  Hydrogen Ion Concentration (pH): The soil has a pH between 4.5 and 8.4 in
all horizons within a depth of 40 inches or if the root zone is less than 40 inches
deep.

4.  Drainage and Water Table:  The soil drainage class is either somewhat poorly drained, moderately well
drained, or well drained, or the soils do not support major food, feed, fiber,
forage, and oilseed crops commonly grown in the area.
OR
 The soil map unit has an installed water control system such as drainage
or irrigation, which prevents a high water table or poor drainage from
adversely affecting the production of major food, fiber, forage, and oilseed
crops commonly grown in the area (mainly applicable in moisture zone 1).

5.  Salinity:  The soil lacks a natric horizon (equal to or more than 15 percent
exchangeable sodium).
 Soil can be managed so that the conductivity of saturation extract is less
than 4 mmhos/cm in all horizons within a depth of:
	18 inches if the dominant texture is clay, silty clay, or sandy clay, 10 inches
if irrigated.
	30 inches if the dominant texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay
loam, silt, silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam,
sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.
	40 inches if the dominant texture is loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand,
loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, very fine sand, fine sand, sand,
or coarse sand.

6.  Flooding:  The soil surface is flooded less than once in 2 years (none, rare, or
occasional) during the growing season of crops commonly grown in the
area  AND The soil surface is flooded for less than 2 days (very brief) during the
growing season of crops commonly grown in the area.

7.  Slope:  Soil is not presently gullied, eroded, or severely eroded (degree of erosion
is reflected in the map unit name) AND Soil has a slope gradient equal to or less than 5 percent.

8.  Erosion:  Texas is divided into sectors which determine acceptable soil loss levels
from wind currents for each wind erodibility group.
	Sector A Wind erodibility groups are not a determining factor.
	Sector B Wind erodibility groups, 2, 3, 4, 4L, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are prime
farmland if they meet all other criteria.
	Sector C Wind erodibility groups 3, 4, 4L, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are prime
farmland if they meet all other criteria.
	Sector D Wind erodibility groups 5, 6, 7, and 8 are prime farmland if they
meet all other criteria.
	Sector E Wind erodibility groups 6, 7, and 8 are prime farmland if they
meet all other criteria.

9.  Permeability:  The soil has a permeability rate of at least 0.06 inch per hour in the most
restrictive horizon on the upper 20 inches of the profile.  Permeability rate is not a limiting factor for Vertisols and Vertic subgroups of Entisols and Mollisols.

10.  Rock Fragments: Must meet all three of the following requirements:
	Less than 35 percent by volume of gravel (0.04 to 3 inches in diameter).
	Less than 10 percent by volume of cobbles (3 inches to 10 inches in
diameter).

with tillage.

11.  Calcium Carbonate Equivalent: The soil has a weighted average calcium carbonate equivalent, in the fraction less than 1 inch in diameter, of less than 40 percent between depths of 10 to 40 inches, or in the root zone if less than 40 inches. Soils with mollic epipedons are excluded from this criterion."|05/13/2010 14:21:01|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666384"
"TX201"|"AGR - No Till (TX)"|"suitability"|"AGR - No-Till (TX)

Summary:  Soil interpretations for No-Till (TX) evaluate a soil's suitability for No-Till conservation practices.  These practices includes planting methods commonly referred to as no-till, strip till, direct seed, zero till, slot till or zone till.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

No-Till conservation practices are normally established as part of a conservation management system to address the soil, water, air, plant, and animal needs and the owner's objectives.  No-Till conservation practices manage the amount, orientation and distribution of crop and other plant residue on the soil surface year round while limiting soil-disturbing activities to only those necessary to place nutrients, condition residue and plant crops.  No-Till operations reduce sheet and rill erosion, wind erosion, CO2 emissions, improve soil organic matter content, and increase plant available moisture.

The degree of suitability is expressed as a numeric index between 1 (suited condition) and 0 (unsuited condition).  If an individual soil feature within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface is assigned a degree of suitability less then one, then that soil feature is restrictive and the soil feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum degree of suitability of each soil interpretive feature considered in the rating process.  Soil features having a greater degree of suitability then the minimum are identified and provides the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support No-Till conservation practice.

The degree to which a soil is suited to No-Till conservation practices will range from ""Suited"" to ""Unsuited"".  Soils that have no or very minor limiting features are classified ""Excellent"" for No-Till practices.  The degree of suitability for these soils is => 1.0 and < 0.90.  Soils in rating class ""Good"" have some soil feature or features that may limit No-Till operations but these features do not pose significant constraints to the soils capacity to support No-Till conservation practices.   The degree of suitability for these soils is => 0.90 and < 0.50.  Soils in rating class ""Fair"" have soil feature or features that limit No-Till operations but these features do not render the soil unsuited in its capacity to support No-Till conservation practices.  The degree of suitability for these soils is => 0.50 and < 0.10.  Soils in rating class ""Poor"" have soil feature or features that limit No-Till operations and these features pose significant constraints to the soils capacity to support No-Till conservation practices.  The degree of suitability for these soils is => 0.10 and =< 0.0.  

Scope: The soil properties and qualities considered in the ratings are those that affect tillage operation, crop growth, and other necessary mechanical operations.  The soil properties that affect No-Till practice establishment and continuance are soil drainage, surface gravel, cobbles, and stones, flooding, ponding, depth to water table, slope, depth, and soil stickiness.

"TX201"|"DHS - Potential for Radioactive Bioaccumulation"|"suitability"|"DHS - Hazard of Radioactive Bioaccumulation


Background:

Strontium-90 and Cesium-137 are radionuclides that can be released into the atmosphere as a result of above-ground nuclear explosions and inadvertent leakage from nuclear facilities, such as powerplants.  The behavior of strontium in the soil system is close to calcium.  Both are divalent metal cations.  Strontium, having a slightly smaller hydrated radius is more tightly held by the exchange complex than calcium.  Cesium acts in a fashion similar to potassium.  Both are monovalent metal cations.  Cesium is held more tightly that potassium, due to a smaller hydrated radius.  The characteristics of the soil upon which the radionuclides fall determines whether or not and to what extent they are available to plants and subsequently to animals.

Cations such as strontium or cesium added to the surface of the soil as fallout can have one of several fates.  

1 - They can be taken up by plants and cycled in the organic matter of the soil.  This is particularly true in acidic forest soils where the pH is below 5.5.  At this level of pH, aluminum solubilizes and can become the dominant cation in many soils, essentially driving basic cations off of the exchange into solution, where either they are absorbed by plant roots or they leach from the soil system. 
2 - They can be tied to the exchange surface and rendered more or less unavailable for plant uptake.  Owing to their small concentrations and generally high affinity for adsorption by the exchange, a soil having a large supply of basic cations and plentiful exchange sites will bind the radionuclides away from absorption by plant roots owing simply to mass action.  
3 - If the soil lacks the exchange capacity or the soil reaction is unfavorable for attenuation, they can be leached below the root zone and eventually into ground water or surface waters.  
4 - If the soil contains carbonates or sulfates, strontium can be tied up in the structures of these compounds.  
5 - Cesium, which is similar in ionic radius and charge to potassium can be absorbed by 2:1 layer silicates.

The bioaccumulation of cesium and strontium is favored by several soil conditions.  Low cation exchange capacity in the upper 30cm of soil causes these ions to be in soil solution rather than absorbed.  Low pH (below 5.5) causes the exchange complex to be largely aluminum saturated, which pushes cesium and strontium into soil solution.  A thick organic surface serves as a reservoir for cesium and strontium, especially for uptake and retention by fungi.  A lack of clay minerals in the soil enhances the extent of plant uptake and bioaccumulation.  When first deposited, particulate to which cesium and strontium are adsorbed can be moved around on the landscape by water and wind.  If calcium carbonate or gypsum are present, strontium can be tightly held in these minerals and not available for uptake. 


Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member, or complete members of the set of soils that are suspected of having a high  Hazard for Radioactive Bioaccumulation of radionuclides in plant material growing on the soil component.  If a soil's properties within 30 cm (~12 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater than zero, then that soil property contributes to the bioaccumulation of radioactive material.  The interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Hazard for Radioactive Bioaccumulation"" interpretive rule.  Minor contributing soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These contributing features could be important factors where the major contributing features are overcome through management, when possible.  Studies from Europe indicate a fairly low mobility in soils, so only the upper 30cm of the profile is considered (Hrachowitz et al, 2005).

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are very low bioaccumulation hazard (rating index = 0), some bioaccumulation hazard (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or high bioaccumulation hazard (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Potential for Radioactive Bioaccumulation is a method of arraying soils based on their hazard for bioaccumulating radionuclides.  This information can be displayed spatially to show the extent and location of areas where bioaccumulation may occur in the event of a leakage of radioactive material.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Criteria Used:


1.  In a soil where little leaching occurs, calcium carbonate or gypsum can accumulate, depending on how dry the soil is.  This subrule rule tests for either calcium carbonate or gypsum.  The lowest fuzzy number is sent to the main rule level.


Subrules used:

NSSC Data:Bioaccumulation carbonate
NSSC Data:Bioaccumulation gypsum
 The lowest fuzzy number result from these two rules is used.

	A.  Calcium carbonate in the soil tightly holds strontium, so if a soil has appreciable carbonates, the potential for sequestration is high. 


Property used: CALCIUM CARBONATE FROM 0 to 30cm


Limits:

	CCE	0	no sequestering from CaCO3
	CCE	0-10	some sequestering from CaCO3
	CCE	>10	high degree of sequestering from CaCO3
	
	Null CaCO3 is assigned 0.
	
	
	B.  Calcium sulfate (gypsum) in the soil tightly holds strontium, so if a soil has appreciable gypsum content, the potential for sequestration is high.


Property used: GYPSUM FROM 0 to 30cm


Limits:

	gypsum	0	no sequestering from gypsum
	gypsum	0-10	some sequestering from gypsum
	gypsum	>10	high degree of sequestering from gypsum
	
	Null gypsum is assigned 0.
	
	
	
2.  Sorption:  This subrule tests the interaction of pH and CEC against the thickness of the organic surface.  These two factors represent the exchange complex of the soil.  The higher of the two fuzzy numbers is sent to the main level rule.


Subrules used:

NSSC Data: Bioaccumulation pH X CEC
NSSC Data: Bioaccumulation Organic Surface


	A.  It is thought that pH and CEC interact in influencing the availability of cesium and strontium in soil solution.  When pH and CEC are both high, then the availability of these ions is decreased.  When pH and CEC are both low, then the availability of these ions is higher.  Also, if one or the other of pH and CEC is lower, then the availability is increased.  In fuzzy systems as well as regression models, interaction of variables is indicated by multiplying them together.

	B.  The surface organic layer in many soils provides a reservoir for plant available nutrients.  Cesium and strontium act similar to the plant nutrients potassium and calcium and are treated in a similar manner by plants.  It is assumed in this subrule that a thicker layer will retain more strontium and cesium for cyclical reuse by plants.  Any material leaching below the surface is intercepted and incorporated into plant tissue to be returned to the soil when the plant dies.

3.  Surface redistribution:  Concave areas on the landscape tend to accumulate water and material that erodes from adjacent areas.  Strontium and cesium are added to the soil surface as fallout and are thus susceptible to redistribution by erosion, especially when newly deposited on a surface lacking an organic layer.  The general consensus is that very little erosion occurs on soils having an O horizon.  Some soils are more erodible than others, due to their composition, as is related by the K factor.  Slope is a contributor to erosion.

"TX201"|"ENG - Construction Materials; Reclamation"|"suitability"|"Summary:

Soil survey interpretations for construction materials are made to provide guidance to users in selecting the site of a potential source.  Soils may be selected as potential source materials because they are nearby, are the only source available, or meets some or all of the physical or chemical properties required for the intended application.  In theory, every soil may be used as source materials, but in reality, only a few soils have the profile characteristics that meet the defined criteria and performance requirements when rated for a specific propose.  The use of rating guides can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.

Suitability ratings and associated restrictive features are for roadfill, topsoil, sand, gravel, and soil reconstruction material.  The ratings do not consider the quality of the source material because quality depends on how the source material is to be used.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine the suitability and quality of the materials for the intended purpose.  Implementation of these interpretations helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by pinpointing potential sites.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are suited as a source of ""Reclamation"" material.  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property contributes to the soils potential as a source of reclamation material.  The soil property contributing lest is identified as the soil feature making this soil a less then a desirable source of reclamation material.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of the soil interpretive property that comprise the "" Reclamation"" interpretive rule.  

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Soil reconstruction of areas drastically disturbed, as in surface mining, is the process of replacing layers of soil material or unconsolidated geologic material, or both, in a vertical sequence of such quality and thickness that a favorable medium for plant growth is provided.

Most new state strip mine programs emphasize that the land surface be restored to about its natural configuration or better and that the soil be reconstructed to maintain or improve its suitability for the intended use.  Thus, knowledge of the soil and underlying material is needed to plan proper reconstruction operations of mined land.  This guide for soil reconstruction material evaluates the material as a medium for plant growth.  This guide does not cover areas of quarry, pit, dredge, and older surface mine operations that require an offsite source of soil reconstruction material.

When the soil materials are properly used in reconstruction, a rating of good means that vegetation is relatively easy to establish and maintain, that the surface is stable and resists erosion, and that the reconstructed soil has good potential productivity.  Material rated fair can be vegetated and stabilized by modifying one or more properties.  Topdressing with better material or applications of soil amendments may be necessary for satisfactory performance.  Material rated poor has such severe problems that revegetation and stabilization are very difficult and costly.  Topdressing with better material is necessary to establish and maintain vegetation.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of reconstruction material.  The soil interpretation for reconstruction material source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

Vegetation is difficult to establish on soils that have high pH.  Many of these soils also have a high sodium adsorption ratio, which indicates potential instability and water transmission problems.  Materials that are extremely acid or have the potential upon oxidation of becoming extremely acid are difficult and expensive to vegetate.  They also contribute to poor water quality, in runoff or in ground water.

The available water capacity also is important in establishing vegetation.  Soils that have a low available water capacity may require irrigation for the establishment of vegetation.

The stability of the soil depends upon its erodibility by water and wind and its strength.  Water erodibility is indicated by the K factor; wind erodibility is rated according to the ""I"" value of the wind erodibility group.  Potential slippage hazard is related to soil texture, and although other factors also contribute, the ratings of soil texture represent one important factor.

The fraction 3-10 inches is a weight percentage of rock fragments in the material used for soil reconstruction.  The amount and size of rock fragments influence the ease of excavation, stockpiling, and respreading and the suitability for the final use of the land.  A certain amount of rock fragments can be tolerated depending upon their size and the intended use of the reclaimed area.  If the size of rock fragments exceeds 10 inches, problems are more severe.

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:


Generally, the upper part of the soil, which is richest in organic matter, is most desirable for use as medium or cover material; however, material excavated from deeper layers is also used.  In this rating, the upper 100cm of soil material is evaluated for use as topsoil.  In the borrow area, the material below 100cm inches is evaluated for its suitability for plant growth after the upper 100cm is removed.

Scope: National

Soil properties that are used to rate the soil as a composting medium and final cover material are those that affect plant growth; the ease of excavation, loading, and spreading; and the reclamation of the borrow area.

The physical and chemical soil properties and qualities that influence plant growth are the presence of toxic substances, soil reaction, and those properties that are inferred from the soil texture, such as the available water capacity and fertility.  The properties that influence the ease of excavation, loading, and spreading are the amount of rock fragments, slope, depth to the water table, soil texture, and thickness of suitable material.  The properties that influence the reclamation of the borrow area are the slope, depth to the water table, amount of rock fragments, depth to rock, and the presence of toxic material.  The presence of even a small percentage of rock fragments in excess of 4.7mm is detrimental to the desirability of the compost material produced.

"TX201"|"DHS - Suitability for Clay Liner Material"|"suitability"|"Clay Liner for Waste Disposal				

Clay Liner for Waste Disposal is a constructed geologic barrier used to confine and isolate solid and liquid waste in disposal sites where protection of soil, ground water, and surface water is important.  The primary objective of the geologic barrier is to control leachate and gas migration.  Flexible membranes and drainage layers may be used with clay liner for waste disposal.  In some situations, bentonite is added to soils low in clay to achieve the desired hydraulic conductivity.

This interpretation rates potential sites for sources of clay liner material.  The primary assumption for clay liner for waste disposal is that the hydraulic conductivity of soils or geologic materials in the foundation of the waste disposal site is too high and leachate and gases from the buried waste can migrate into the soil, ground water, or surface water.  It is assumed that the source clay liner material would be a minimum of 50 cm thick before it would be feasible to excavate.  The material should be free of large rock fragments, roots, or other debris since it would be difficult to screen such clayey material to separate undesirable components.  Once it is excavated, it would be transported to the waste disposal site and it would be placed directly into the trench.  Water would be added if needed for appropriate compaction.  Bentonite would be added to the clay liner material at this time also, if needed. 

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water through seepage or migration of gases.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property, such as the use of a flexible membrane, drainage layers, or increased thickness of the geologic barrier.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 feet).  However, because excavations may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates or migration of gases to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of rough bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in getting an adequate seal at the boundary of the rock and the Clay Liner material that would adequately reduce the potential pollution of underground water.

Soil properties that influence the risk of pollution and the ease of excavation and installation or compaction are major considerations.  Soils that have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in installing the liner.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the clay liner material is dug and placed is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil also determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact.  The Plasticity Index and the mineralogy of the soil help define the consistency of the soil.  

See the Daily Cover for Waste Disposal, Large-scale Event national soil interpretation to determine if suitable soils materials are available for the final cover of the site.  It may be desirable to stockpile the surface soil layer in the Clay Liner borrow area for use in the final blanketing of the fill.

The minimum requirements for the geologic barrier are as follows:

Landfill for hazardous waste - Ksat 10-9 m/sec  thickness  5 m
Landfill for non-hazardous waste - Ksat 10-9 m/sec  thickness  1 m
Landfill for inert waste - Ksat 10-7 m/sec  thickness  1 m
(Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Subtitle B - Ksat 10-7 cm/sec  thickness  2 ft, flexible membrane at least 60 mil (1.5 mm)).
(EPA - 3 ft soil layer) 

Criteria:
1.	Soil shall be free of roots, debris, organic or frozen material.
2.	Soil shall have a maximum clod size of 50 mm (2 in) at the time of compaction.
3.	Soil max. particle size  25 mm
(12.5 mm if flexible membrane is used)*
4.	Soil min. percent passing 4.75 mm sieve  80
5.	Soil min. percent passing 0.075 mm sieve  50
6.	Soil min. liquid limit  35
7.	Soil min. plasticity index  10
8.	Soil max. plasticity index  40

These criteria were determined based on information from the following references:

*In the NASIS database, no size breaks easily equivalent to these sizes are used.  There is no break between 4.76 (number 4 sieve) and 75 mm.  It was thought that basing the rating on the material passing the Number 4 sieve would be too restrictive so the 75 mm size is used to approximate the 25 mm.  As a concession, the amount of >75mm material allowed is kept very low (5 percent).



Criteria Used:


1.  Area reclaim:  Soil reconstruction of areas drastically disturbed, as in obtaining material for a clay liner, is the process of replacing layers of soil material or unconsolidated geologic material, or both, in a vertical sequence of such quality and thickness that a favorable medium for plant growth is provided.

When the soil materials are properly used in reconstruction, a rating of good means that vegetation is relatively easy to establish and maintain, that the surface is stable and resists erosion, and that the reconstructed soil has good potential productivity.  Material rated fair can be vegetated and stabilized by modifying one or more properties.  Topdressing with better material or applications of soil amendments may be necessary for satisfactory performance.  Material rated poor has such severe problems that revegetation and stabilization are very difficult and costly.  Topdressing with better material is necessary to establish and maintain vegetation.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of reconstruction material.  The soil interpretation for reconstruction material source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Vegetation is difficult to establish on soils that have high pH.  Many of these soils also have a high sodium adsorption ratio, which indicates potential instability and water transmission problems.  Materials that are extremely acid or have the potential upon oxidation of becoming extremely acid are difficult and expensive to vegetate.  They also contribute to poor water quality, in runoff or in ground water.

The available water capacity also is important in establishing vegetation.  Soils that have a low available water capacity may require irrigation for the establishment of vegetation.

The stability of the soil depends upon its erodibility by water and wind and its strength.  Water erodibility is indicated by the K factor; wind erodibility is rated according to the ""I"" value of the wind erodibility group.  Potential slippage hazard is related to soil texture, and although other factors also contribute, the ratings of soil texture represent one important factor.

The fraction 3-10 inches is a weight percentage of rock fragments in the material used for soil reconstruction.  The amount and size of rock fragments influence the ease of excavation, stockpiling, and respreading and the suitability for the final use of the land.  A certain amount of rock fragments can be tolerated depending upon their size and the intended use of the reclaimed area.  If the size of rock fragments exceeds 10 inches, problems are more severe.

3.  Depth to saturation:  Soil that is saturated with water has lower bearing strength and has reduced workability.  Saturation (water table) depth criteria are as follows.

	Property evaluated: DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM  (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Not suited		 < 100cm
		Somewhat suited 	=> 100 to =< 200cm
		Well suited		 > 200cm
		
	Null depth to saturation is assigned  to the Well suited class.
	
	
	
4.  Flooding, or inundation with moving water, can cause damage to facilities and loss of property and life.  Flood waters can transport material away from the site and can deposit unwanted material on the site.  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional flooding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value less than 1 and flooding is a limiting feature:

Flooding Frequency	Months
------------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2


5.  Surface fragments:  Soil that is has large fragments on the surface have reduced trafficability.  The large rock fragments on the surface must be removed.  Rock fragment coverage criteria are as follows.

	Property evaluated: FRAGMENTS >=250MM ON THE SURFACE  (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Poorly suited		 > 15 percent
		Somewhat suited 	=> 2 to 15 percent
		Well suited		 < 2 percent
		
	Null surface fragment coverage is assigned to the Well suited class.
	
	
	
6.  Hard to pack:  The amount of soil material passing the number 200 sieve, the liquid limit, and the plasticity index of soil material relates to its compactability.  Optimally, the material used for a clay liner should be readily compacted to a layer having low water transmission capabilities. 


These three soil characteristics are examined.  The least favorable of the three determines the soil's desirability as material for a clay liner.

	1.  Property evaluated: 200 SIEVE 30-200cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER WTD_AVE (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Poorly suited		< 50 percent
		Somewhat suited 	> 50 to < 80 percent
		Well suited		>= 80 percent
		
	Null Number 200 sieve is assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	

	2.  Property evaluated: PI 30-200cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER WTD_AVE (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Poorly suited		< 10 and over 80 percent
		Somewhat suited 	>= 10 to 40 and 55 to > 80 percent
		Well suited		> 40 to 55 percent

	3.  Property evaluated: LL 30-200cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER WTD_AVE (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Poorly suited		< 35 percent
		Somewhat suited 	> 35 to <= 60 percent
		Well suited		> 60 percent
		
	Null liquid limit is assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	
	
7.  Thin layer:  If the thickness of the soil layer is thin, excavation of the material is not worthwhile.  The upper 30 cm of the material is to be used to reclaim the site.  The depth of soil material available will range from 30 cm to either about 200 cm (the maximum depth easily excavated) or to the top of a cemented soil layer, such as bedrock, caliche, or duripan.

Property evaluated: SOIL DEPTH TO FIRST CEMENTED RESTRICTION BELOW O HORIZON  (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Poorly suited		 < 50 cm
		Somewhat suited 	> 50 to 170 cm
		Well suited		 > 170 cm
		
	Null Component Restriction is assigned to the well suited class.
	
	
	
8.  Compactable material:  The amount of soil material passing the number 4 sieve relates to its compactability.  Optimally, the material used for a clay liner should be readily compacted to a layer having low water transmission capabilities.  The weighted average of the material bewtween 30 and 200 cm is examined.  The weighted average is used because it is assumed the material will be subjected to at least a small amount of stirring during processing. 

	Property evaluated: 4 SIEVE 30-200cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER WTD_AVE (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Poorly suited		< 80 percent
		Somewhat suited 	> 80 to < 100 percent
		Well suited		>= 100 percent
		
	Null Number 4 sieve is assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	
	
9.  Ponding:  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional ponding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value less than 1 and ponding is a limiting feature:

Ponding Frequency	Months
-----------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2


10.  Rock fragments:  The rock fragment content of a soil influences its usefulness as material for a clay liner.  Rock fragments decrease the compactability and provide planes of weakness for water flow.  Also, they may pucture the plastic liner if one is used.  Optimally, the material used for a clay liner should be free of rock fragments greater than 2.5 cm in diameter.  This rule keys on rock fragments in the 3 to 10 inch range.

	Property evaluated: FRAGMENTS >75mm 30-200cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION, WTD_AVE (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Poorly suited		> 5 percent  
		Somewhat suited 	<= 5 to 0 percent
		Well suited		0 percent
		
	Null rock fragments 3 to 10 and rock > 10 are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	
	
11.  Slope:  The slope of the soil surface influences its trafficability for equipment and also can cause erosion hazard if steep.

	Property evaluated: SLOPE (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Poorly suited		> 8 percent  
		Somewhat suited 	<= 8 to 3 percent
		Well suited		< 3 percent
		
	Null slopes are assigned to the Not rated class.

12.  Gypsum content:  Gypsum is soluble.  Dissolution of the clay liner material could allow penetration by noxious materials.

Property used:  GYPSUM WTD_AVE FROM 20CM

Interpretive limits:  	                Well suited  		0 percent gypsum
			Somewhat suited		0 to 5 percent gypsum
			Poorly suited		>5 percent gypsum"|07/19/2018 19:46:25|09/08/2021 17:20:14|5|"13287"|"6666454"

Summary:  Military category type 1 vehicles are lightweight vehicles with low contact pressure (less than 2.0 pounds per square inch) such as amphibious tracked vehicles used to carry cargo.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 1.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for one vehicle pass.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

Summary:  Military category type 1 vehicles are lightweight vehicles with low contact pressure (less than 2.0 pounds per square inch).  Soils trafficability during the dry season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 1.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (1) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships, which produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

Summary:  Military category type-2 vehicles are engineer and high speed tractors with comparatively wide tracks and low contact pressures.  Soils trafficability during the dry season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 2.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (1) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1.	Slipperiness:  Slipperiness is the condition where the soil has a potential to become slick when used for vehicular traffic.  During the dry season this condition is most common and persistent were the soil is ponded, flooded, or has a high water table.  If these conditions are not present soil may become slippery after precipitation events but the condition is not persistent.

Summary:   Military category type-3 vehicles are tractors with average contact pressures, tanks with comparatively low contact pressures, and some trailed vehicles with very low contact pressures.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 3.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for 50 vehicle passes in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

Summary:  Military category type-4 vehicles are most medium tanks, tractors with high contact pressures, and all-wheel-drive trucks and trailed vehicles with low contact pressures.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 4.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for 50 vehicle passes in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for one vehicle pass.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

Summary:  Military category type-5 vehicles are most all-wheel-drive trucks, a great number of trailed vehicles, and heavy tanks.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 5.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Summary:  Military category type-6 vehicles are a great number of all-wheel-drive and rear-wheel-drive trucks and trailed vehicles intended primarily for highway use such as the 10 ton 6x6 M125A1 .  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 6.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for one vehicle pass.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

Summary:  Military category type-7 vehicles are rear-wheel-drive vehicles and others that generally are not expected to operate off road, especially in wet soils.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 7.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for one vehicle pass.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

"TX201"|"ENG - Construction Materials; Roadfill"|"suitability"|"Summary:

Soil survey interpretations for construction materials are made to provide guidance to users in selecting the site of a potential source.  Soils may be selected as potential source materials because they are nearby, are the only source available, or meets some or all of the physical or chemical properties required for the intended application.  In theory, every soil may be used as source materials, but in reality, only a few soils have the profile characteristics that meet the defined criteria and performance requirements when rated for a specific propose.  The use of rating guides can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.

Suitability ratings and associated restrictive features are for roadfill, topsoil, sand, gravel, and soil reconstruction material.  The ratings do not consider the quality of the source material because quality depends on how the source material is to be used.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine the suitability and quality of the materials for the intended purpose.  Implementation of these interpretations helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by pinpointing potential sites.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are suited as a source of ""Roadfill"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property contributes to the soil's potential as a source of roadfill.  The soil property contributing lest is identified as the soil feature making this soil a less then a desirable source of roadfill.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of the soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Roadfill"" interpretive rule.

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Roadfill consists of soil material that is excavated from its original position and used in road embankments elsewhere.  The evaluations for roadfill are for low embankments that generally are less than 6 feet in height and are less exacting in design than high embankments, such as those along superhighways.  The rating is given for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 5 feet, based on the assumption that soil horizons will be mixed in loading, dumping, and spreading.  In Table 620-7 criteria, limits, and restrictive features for rating soils for local roads and streets are given.  Soils are rated as to the amount of material available for excavation, the ease of excavation, and how well the material performs after it is in place.

Scope: National

Soil properties that affect the amount of material available for excavation are thickness of suitable material above bedrock or other material that is not suitable.  The percent of coarse fragments more than 3 inches in diameter, the depth to a seasonal high water table, and the slope are properties that influence the ease of excavation.  How well the soil performs in place is indicated by the AASHTO classification and group index and by the shrink-swell potential.  A high content of gypsum can cause piping or pitting.  Some damage to the borrow area is expected; but if revegetation and erosion control are likely to be difficult, the soil is rated severe.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most suited of the following soil features.

	1.  Cobble content: Excessive cobbles (rock fragments, 3 to 10 inches in size) in the upper 40 inches (100 cm) of the soil can interfere with construction equipment and grade stabilization.  Soil feature considered is percent weighted average by weight coarse fragments 3 to 10 inches in size in the upper 40 inches of soil.

	Null 3 to 10 inch rock fragments are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	2.  Shrink-swell: Excessive shrink-swell (weighted average) between 25 and 150cm deep can cause roads to shift and paving to crack.  Soil feature considered is weighted average percent linear extensibility between a depth of 10 to 60 inches or above bedrock.

	4.  Stone content: Excessive stones (rock fragments, > 10 inch in size) in the upper 40 inches (100 cm) of the soil can interfere with construction equipment and packing.

		Not limiting		<= 5%
		
	Null > 10 inch rock fragment data are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	5.  Low strength: Soils with high AASHTO Group Index have low strength which affects the soil's traffic-supporting capacity and reduces the soil's potential as a site for roadfill.  This condition is only partially restrictive when clay mineralogy is kaolinitic.  Soil feature considered is the AASHTO Group Index of the thickest soil layer below 25cm or to a cemented restrictive layer and taxonomic family mineralogy.

	7.  Depth to bedrock: The depth to bedrock limits the volume of material suitable for use as roadfill.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"" or ""bedrock (paralithic)."" Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	Null hardness is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	9.  Depth to saturated zone: Soils with shallow depth to a water table have limited volume of material suitable for use as fill materials and maybe difficult to reclaim and revegetated.  These areas are slow to drain and can become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month.

	Property used: HIGH WATER TABLE DEPTH MINIMUM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		=< 30cm
		Somewhat limiting	 > 30 to < 90cm
		Not limiting		=> 90cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

10.  Gypsum content -- Roads, pipelines, and structures built on soils containing gypsum are susceptible to damage from differential settling if the gypsum should dissolve to due the addition of water to the soil.  Subsidence is estimated from the gypsum content of the soil.  Other soluble salts may also contribute to the loss of volume of the soil.  

Assumptions:

* Differential subsidence is assumed to always occur, rather than an equidimensional settling.
* Water as irrigation, leakage, septic systems, or whatever is assumed to be applied.  If no water is added to the soil, no dissolution occurs and therfore no subsidence.
* Dissolution kinetics are assumed to be such that the settling is observable in our lifetimes.
* The size of the structure has an influence on the tolerable amount of distortion due to settling.
* The age of the structure influences the amount of damage it will sustain if differential subsidence occurs.
* The particle size of the gypsum will influence the dissolution rate.  A generic rate is assumed here.

11. Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of traffic on the road.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is less than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

12.  Liquefaction -- Some soils can hold so much water that they lose strength under stress and can flow as a liquid.  This condition is indicated by a Unified Classification of OH-T.  This is a proposed classification for some volcanic soils found on the islands in the Pacific, although the condition could exist elsewhere as well.  This should not be confused with seismically-induced liquefaction, although these soils would be affected by a siesmic event.

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Gravel as a construction material is defined as particles ranging in size from 4.76 mm (sieve #4) to 76 mm (3 inches) in diameter.  Gravel is used in great quantities in many kinds of construction.  Specifications for each purpose vary widely.  The intent of this rating is to show only the probability of finding material in suitable quantity.  The suitability of the gravel for specific purposes is not evaluated.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of gravel.  The soil interpretation for gravel source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

The properties used to evaluate the soil as a probable source of gravel are grain size as indicated by the Unified soil classification, the thickness of the gravel layer, and the amount of rock fragments in the soil material.  If the lowest layer of the soil contains gravel, the soil is rated as a probable source regardless of thickness.  The assumption is that the gravel layer below the depth of observation exceeds the minimum thickness.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most suited of the following soil features.

	1.  Bottom layer: If the bottom layer contains significant amounts of material that passes the #4 sieve and not the #200 sieve, and does not contain rocks or coarse fragments, then the bottom layer is a potential source for sand.  The bottom layer takes precedence over the thickest layer.   There is no layer thickness restriction on the bottom layer.  The following child rules are joined by the AND operator and the one with the lowest index number determine the interpretive result.

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sand as a construction material is usually defined as particles ranging in size from 0.074 mm (sieve #200) to 4.75 mm (sieve #4) in diameter.  Sand is used in great quantities in many kinds of construction.  Specifications for each purpose vary widely.  The intent of this rating is to show only the probability of finding material in suitable quantity.  The suitability of the sand for specific purposes is not evaluated.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of sand.  The soil interpretation for sand source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

The properties used to evaluate the soils as a probable source of sand are the grain size as indicated by the Unified soil classification, the thickness of the sand layer, and the amount of rock fragments in the soil material.  They are listed in Table 620-8.  If the lowest layer of the soil contains sand, the soil is rated as a probable source regardless of thickness.  The assumption is that the sand layer below the depth of observation exceeds the minimum thickness.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most suited of the following soil features.

"TX201"|"ENG - Construction Materials; Topsoil"|"suitability"|"Summary:

Soil survey interpretations for construction materials are made to provide guidance to users in selecting the site of a potential source.  Soils may be selected as potential source materials because they are nearby, are the only source available, or meets some or all of the physical or chemical properties required for the intended application.  In theory, every soil may be used as source materials, but in reality, only a few soils have the profile characteristics that meet the defined criteria and performance requirements when rated for a specific propose.  The use of rating guides can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.

Suitability ratings and associated restrictive features are for roadfill, topsoil, sand, gravel, and soil reconstruction material.  The ratings do not consider the quality of the source material because quality depends on how the source material is to be used.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine the suitability and quality of the materials for the intended purpose.  Implementation of these interpretations helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by pinpointing potential sites.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are suited as a source of ""Topsoil"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property contributes to the soil's potential as a source of topsoil.  The soil property contributing lest is identified as the soil feature making this soil a less then a desirable source of topsoil.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of the soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Topsoil"" interpretive rule.

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

The term ""topsoil"" has several meanings.  As used here, the term describes soil material used to cover an area and improve soil conditions for the establishment and maintenance of adapted vegetation. 

Generally, the upper part of the soil, which is richest in organic matter, is most desirable for use as topsoil; however, material excavated from deeper layers is also used.  In this rating, the upper 40 inches of soil material is evaluated for use as topsoil.  In the borrow area, the material below 40 inches is evaluated for its suitability for plant growth after the upper 40 inches is removed.

Scope: National

Soil properties that are used to rate the soil as topsoil are those that affect plant growth; the ease of excavation, loading, and spreading; and the reclamation of the borrow area.

The physical and chemical soil properties and qualities that influence plant growth are the presence of toxic substances, soil reaction, and those properties that are inferred from the soil texture, such as the available water capacity and fertility.  The properties that influence the ease of excavation, loading, and spreading are the amount of rock fragments, slope, depth to the water table, soil texture, and thickness of suitable material.  The properties that influence the reclamation of the borrow area are the slope, depth to the water table, amount of rock fragments, depth to rock, and the presence of toxic material.

                        16.  Aluminum saturation -- Some agricultural crops suffer from aluminum toxicity when the Al saturation is only 10%. Aluminum interferes with the photosynthetic cycle by complexing with phosphate, so with high soluble aluminum the plant is starved for phosphate. Al-toxicity also stunts root growth thereby limiting the amount of soil the plant can exploit for nutrients. Stunted roots can also limit water uptake and can cause plants to wilt with only a few days without water. Some plants (e.g. cassava) have high tolerance to high levels of soluble aluminum. High soluble Al and acidity may adversely affect soil health by inhibiting beneficial organisms. When liming soils with high soluble aluminum the rule of thumb is to add 1.5 tons of CaCO3 per acre for every milliequivalents of soluble aluminum. The pH only needs to be raised to about 5.5 to eliminate the harmful effects of high soluble aluminum. (Source: Dr. Robert Gavenda, PhD; PowerPoint presentation on soil degradation)

About one-third of the tropics (1.5 billion hectares) has sufficiently strong soil acidity for soluble aluminum to be toxic to most crop species. This constraint is defined as having more than 60% Al saturation in some part of the top 50 cm of soil. A soil pH value of less than 5.5 usually indicates this problem (Evans and Kamprath, 1970). Aluminum toxicity is most prevalent in the humid tropics and acid savannas. This constraint is found mainly in soils classified as oxisols, ultisols and closely related inceptisols and is correlated with low nutrient capital reserves. Aluminum toxicity is usually the overwhelming constraint in these soils and must be tackled first, either by modern lime application practices, by using Al-tolerant plant species or by breeding for Al-tolerant varieties (Sanchez and Salinas, 1981). It is relevant to note that aluminum toxicity is rare in most smallholder farming areas of subhumid and semiarid Africa, except for parts of Rwanda, Burundi, Northern Zambia, Southern Congo, KwaZulu Natal Province in South Africa and in some sandy soils of Zimbabwe (Sanchez et al., 1997). Two-thirds of the tropics does not have enough aluminum saturation to worry about. Aluminum toxicity can become a positive soil quality attribute when using Al-tolerant plants in P-deficient soils. The low pH facilitates the dissolution of phosphate rocks, letting, in effect, the H+ ions in the soil do what a superphosphate factory doestreating rock phosphates with acids (Sanchez and Salinas, 1981). High aluminum saturation, as defined by this modifier, is also a positive attribute for rubber and tea production (Smith, 1989).

17.  Exchange capacity -- Some soils lack the ability to retain cations.  Application of liming materials and other fertilizers must be more frequent to maintain the intended vegetation.  Cation exchange capacity (CEC) is the measure of how well a soil can retain cations, such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium.  CEC is measured in milliequivalents (meq) per 100 grams soil.  Here a capacity is used and the measurement is milliequivalents per unit volume soil in the rooting depth or to 100cm.  In soils having pH less than 5.5, effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) is reported.

18.   Liquefaction -- Some soils can hold so much water that they lose strength under stress and can flow as a liquid.  This condition is indicated by a Unified Classification of OH-T.  This is a proposed classification for some volcanic soils found on the islands in the Pacific, although the condition could exist elsewhere as well.  This should not be confused with seismically-induced liquefaction, although these soils would be affected by a siesmic event.

19.  Too acid -- In some areas, such as the Pacific Basin, where liming materials are scarce, low pH can render soil material unsuitable for use as topsoil.  If the pH is below 5.5 and the soil is well buffered, the amount of lime needed to raise the pH to levels where plants can grow may be prohibitive.

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS - Surface Irrigation Intake Family (TX)"" evaluate a soil's membership in an irrigation intake family. The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use. 

A soil irrigation intake family is a group or class of soil that have similar water intake characteristics and rates.  The degree of membership is express as a numeric index where 0 is a non-member and 1.0 is a full member of the class.  In order to have membership in a specific intake family all soil properties being evaluated must have membership in the intake family class. 

This Irrigation Application is NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO BE USED IN A REGULATORY MANNER.

Scope:  Soils are placed into their respective intake family based on their intrinsic water infiltration characteristics when the soils water content is near field capacity.  Soils with similar water intake characteristics are members of the same intake family or class. 

Description:  The soil properties and qualities important in placing the soil in it proper intake family are a storage reservoir of 50cm or more, permeability of the surface soil, permeability of the soil layer immediately below the surface layer, internal drainage, and/or the presence of a restrictive layer within 100cm of the surface.

CRITERIA: The intake class conditions are:

Surface Irrigation Intake Family (0.1):  

Surface irrigation includes irrigation practices such as furrow, dike, border, and other irrigation practice exclusive of sprinkler and micro irrigation.  The intake family is used as a design parameter and is based on the soil inherent capacity to absorb and transmits water through the surface layers.  This prototype uses the soil surface and immediately underlying layer Ksat as an indicator of the soil's absorptive and transmission qualities.

A Conservation Tree and Shrub Group (CTSG) is a physiograpic unit or area having similar climatic and edaphic characteristics that control the selection and height growth of trees and shrubs for   windbreaks, orchards, ornamental, and environmental plantings.

Individual soil components are placed in a CTSG using soil rating criteria.  Refer to section 537 of the National Forestry Manual for specific soil rating criteria.

Rather than try to correlate plant data for each and every soil component, a component is evaluated against criteria and placed in a soil group. Woody plants are then correlated to a specific soil group within the identified MLRA (or subdivision thereof). The calculation of soil group uses DRAFT criteria (12-15-08) displayed in Exhibit 537-15 (National Foresty Handbook), which has NOT BEEN UPDATED in the current National Forestry Handbook.

"TX201"|"CZSS - Salinization due to Coastal Saltwater Inundation (CT)"|"class"|"Salinzation due to Coastal Saltwater Inundation 

Research shows that physical and chemical characteristics of soils influence the potential for salinization from coastal saltwater inundation. Coastal saltwater inundation is the movement of saline water over terrestrial soils due to rising sea levels and storm surges as well as other natural and anthropogenic events. The frequency and duration of these events vary, from pulse events associated with sporadic high-intensity coastal storms to long periods of saltwater saturation from rising sea levels migrating inland. Impacts of saltwater inundations include forest loss, reductions in crop yields, nutrient release from the soil, marsh migration inland, expansion of salt tolerant species, and degraded groundwater (USDA Climate Hubs, 2020). As saltwater moves inland, understanding salinization of terrestrial soils will increase our knowledge of environmental impacts along the coast such as marsh migration or the loss of soil fertility in croplands. 

Evaluation Criteria
This interpretation evaluates soil factors that may influence salinization due to coastal saltwater inundation. It  does not consider the duration of the saltwater inundation, groundwater levels, or elevation.

In the early stages of saltwater inundation, high freshwater tables in soils tend to attenuate the impact of salts by reducing the movement of saltwater inland. This eventually leads to lesser impacts from saltwater on soils and lower rates of marsh lateral migration (Hussein, 2009). When saltwater eventually inundates an upland soil, the amount of soluble salts retained is determined by water table fluctuations, soil texture, saturated hydraulic conductivity, cation exchange capacity, and extractable cation exchange capacity (Hussein and Rabenhorst, 2001).  Sandy soil materials in upland areas subject to saltwater inundation tend to have reduced impacts from salts due to lower cation exchange capacities, lower extractable cation exchange capacities, and higher saturated hydraulic conductivities (Broome, 1988). 

The following soil properties and characteristics correspond to criteria identified and deemed significant by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service:
Depth to Water Table
Cation Exchange Capacity or Extractable Cation Exchange Capacity
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity
Slope

Soil Potential Rating Classes
The rating class definitions refer to the potential of the soil to retain salts after inundation by coastal saltwater. 

High Potential: These soils have a combination of characteristics and properties that are very likely to retain salts after inundation by coastal saltwater. Soils will have long-term impacts of salinization due to coastal saltwater inundation.  Impacts include forest loss, reductions in crop yields, nutrient release from the soil, marsh migration inland, expansion of salt tolerant species, loss of critical tidal marsh habitat, and degraded groundwater (USDA Climate Hubs, 2020). Terrestrial soils that already contain ocean-derived salts and have a 1:5 electrical conductivity populated in the National Soils Information System (NASIS) are rated high potential.

Moderately High Potential: These soils have a combination of characteristics and properties that are likely to retain salts after inundation by coastal saltwater. Soils are likely to have long-term impacts of salinization due to coastal saltwater inundation.

Moderate Potential: These soils have a combination of characteristics and properties that are somewhat likely to retain salts after inundation by coastal saltwater. Soils may have long-term impacts of salinization due to coastal saltwater inundation.

Low Potential: These soils have a combination of characteristics and properties that are not likely retain salts after inundation by coastal saltwater. Soils will have little long-term impacts of salinization due to coastal saltwater inundation.

Very Low Potential: These soils have a combination of characteristics and properties that are very unlikely to retain salts after inundation by coastal saltwater. Soils will have very little long-term impacts of salinization due to coastal saltwater inundation.

Not Rated: Soils or miscellaneous areas labeled Not Rated have characteristics and properties that show extreme variability from one location to another. An onsite investigation may be required to determine soil conditions present at the site. Soils that have a subaqueous drainage class or are miscellaneous soil map units are not rated.

"MO143"|7|"BLO"|"Blowout"|A saucer-, cup-, or trough-shaped depression formed by wind erosion on a pre-existing dune or other sand deposit, especially in an area of shifting sand or loose soil or where protective vegetation is disturbed or destroyed. The adjoining accumulation of sand derived from the depression, where recognizable, is commonly included. Blowouts are commonly small. Typically 0.25 to 5 acres.|"255930"
"MO143"|7|"ESO"|"Escarpment, nonbedrock"|A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff, which generally is produced by erosion but can be produced by faulting, that breaks the continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces. Exposed earthy material is non soil or very shallow soil.|"255931"
"MO143"|7|"MAR"|"Marsh or swamp"|A water saturated, very poorly drained area that is intermittently or permanently covered by water. Sedges, cattails, and rushes are the dominate vegetation in marshes, and trees or shrubs are the dominant vegetation in swamps. Not used in map units where the named soils are poorly drained or very poorly drained. Typically 0.25 to 5 acres.|"255932"
"MO143"|7|"SAL"|"Saline spot"|An area where the surface layer has an electrical conductivity of 8 mmhos cm more than the surface layer of the named soils in the surrounding map unit. The surface layer of the surrounding soils has an electrical conductivity of 2 mmhos cm or less. Typically 0.25 to 5 acres.|"255933"
"MO143"|7|"SAN"|"Sandy spot"|A spot where the surface layer is loamy fine sand or coarser in areas where the surface layer of the named soils in the surrounding map unit is very fine sandy loam or finer. Typically 0.25 to 5 acres.|"255934"
"MO143"|7|"WET"|"Wet spot"|A somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained area that is at least two drainage classes wetter than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. Typically 0.25 to 5 acres.|"255935"
